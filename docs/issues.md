# CreatorClip — Issue Backlog

Dependency-ordered. Each issue follows Check → Approve → Build → Review (see `CLAUDE.md`).
**Phase 1 of every issue begins by researching the current industry standard.**

Check `[ ]` → `[x]` when an acceptance criterion is met. Update `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` when an issue closes.

---

## Issue 1: Repo scaffold + Docker Compose + health endpoint
**Depends on**: none
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**What**: New repo with `CLAUDE.md`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
(`app` + `worker` + `postgres` + `redis`), `main.py` with `/health`, `config.py` env loading,
`crypto.py` Fernet helpers.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `docker compose up` brings all four services healthy
- [ ] `GET /health` returns `{status, postgres, redis}`
- [ ] `.env.example` lists every var from SOT
- [ ] Missing required env fails app start with a clear error
- [ ] `pytest` passes with a `/health` smoke test

---

## Issue 2: Postgres schema + Alembic + pgvector
**Depends on**: 1

**What**: SQLAlchemy models for every entity (see `docs/SOT.md` data model) + memory/feedback
tables. pgvector extension enabled. Alembic wired. Encrypted round-trip for token columns.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `alembic upgrade head` creates every table incl. `creator_dna`, `dna_embeddings`, `clip_feedback`, `clip_outcomes`, `preference_models`
- [ ] pgvector column type works (insert + similarity query)
- [ ] Token encrypt/decrypt round-trip test passes
- [ ] Audit log append-only at the app layer

---

## Issue 3: Google/YouTube OAuth + creator session
**Depends on**: 2

**What**: OAuth 2.0 flow (`/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`), minimum YouTube Analytics + Data API
scopes, encrypted token storage + refresh, `get_current_creator` dependency, per-creator
isolation.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Creator completes OAuth; channel identity + tokens persisted (encrypted)
- [ ] Expired access token auto-refreshes
- [ ] Protected routes 401 without a session
- [ ] Cross-creator data access rejected (isolation test)

---

## Issue 4: YouTube data fetch — metrics, retention, activity
**Depends on**: 3

**What**: `youtube/analytics.py` + `youtube/data_api.py`: per-video metrics, timestamp-level
retention curves, demographics, audience-activity windows, video metadata, caption availability.
Caching + backoff. **Resolve transcription-host decision (GPU vs hosted) here.**

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Fetches and stores metrics, retention curves, activity windows for the creator's catalog
- [ ] Quota/backoff handling on 403
- [ ] Minimum-data gate computed from catalog size
- [ ] Tests use recorded fixtures (no live API in CI)

---

## Issue 5: Ingestion pipeline — source + transcript + signals
**Depends on**: 4

**What**: Celery tasks: ingest (creator upload / guarded yt-dlp → R2), transcribe (WhisperX or
hosted, word-level), audio signals (energy/silence/laughter), unified signal timeline.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] A linked/uploaded video runs ingest → transcribe → signals as background tasks with status
- [ ] Word-level transcript persisted
- [ ] Signal timeline persisted (audio + retention-spike markers merged)
- [ ] `yt-dlp` path guarded to own-content only; off by default
- [ ] Tests cover the task chain with a short fixture clip

---

## Issue 6: Creator DNA builder + brief (Research Mode)
**Depends on**: 5

**What**: `dna/builder.py` ranks by engagement, analyzes top/bottom performers + Shorts-specific
patterns; `dna/brief.py` synthesizes a plain-language brief via Claude (prompt-cached corpus);
embeddings → pgvector; creator confirms → living profile.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Produces top/bottom analysis + Shorts patterns (extraction point, optimal length, upload gap, ratio)
- [ ] Generates an editable plain-language Creator Brief
- [ ] Confirmed brief persists as a versioned DNA profile; edits supersede, never delete
- [ ] Recency weighting applied to performer selection
- [ ] Anthropic calls use prompt caching; tokens logged

---

## Issue 7: Clip engine — candidates with backward setup-finding
**Depends on**: 6

**What**: `clip_engine/window.py` rolling 60–90s window; `candidates.py` peak detection +
**backward look to setup start**; produces candidate windows.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Given a signal timeline, emits candidate windows with `setup_start_s`, `peak_s`, `end_s`
- [ ] **Eval assertion**: on labeled fixtures, clip start lands at the setup, not the post-peak aftermath
- [ ] Configurable candidate count
- [ ] Pure logic where possible; deterministic given fixed input

---

## Issue 8: Clip scoring + DNA-weighted ranking
**Depends on**: 7

**What**: `scoring.py` combines signal features + Claude DNA-fit judgment (cached on DNA
profile); `ranking.py` orders by predicted fit. No preference model yet (cold-start path).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Each candidate gets a `score` and `dna_match`
- [ ] Ranking reflects DNA (clips matching the brief rank higher) on a fixture
- [ ] Claude scoring rationale citable ("why this clip?")
- [ ] Tokens logged; prompt caching verified

---

## Issue 9: Render — 9:16 cut + active-speaker reframe
**Depends on**: 8

**What**: `render.py` ffmpeg cut + vertical reframe (face/active-speaker-centered) → R2;
render status on the clip.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Candidate renders to a playable 9:16 Short
- [ ] Reframe keeps the speaker in frame on a fixture
- [ ] Render runs as a Celery task with status
- [ ] Output stored to configured storage backend

---

## Issue 10: Review UI + feedback capture
**Depends on**: 9

**What**: Player-first `review.html`: play, upvote/downvote/skip, drag-trim, choose format,
Next; `routers/review.py` persists every interaction as a label. **Decide the review-UI
framework question in Phase 1.**

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Creator can review a queue of candidate clips without full page reloads
- [ ] Each action (vote/skip/trim-delta/format) writes a `clip_feedback` row
- [ ] Trim handles produce timing-delta labels
- [ ] Tests cover the feedback endpoints end-to-end

---

## Issue 11: Preference model — recency-decayed reranker
**Depends on**: 10

**What**: `preference/` feature vectors + LightGBM/logistic reranker with exponential recency
decay; retrain per session; rerank candidates; surface the personalization threshold.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Feedback updates a per-creator model
- [ ] Recency decay verifiably down-weights old feedback (unit test)
- [ ] Reranking shifts candidate order after the threshold volume
- [ ] Below threshold, falls back to DNA + signal ranking with an honest UI label

---

## Issue 12: Upload intelligence + improvement brief
**Depends on**: 11

**What**: `upload_intel/timing.py` best window + optimal gap from audience activity;
`improvement/brief.py` what's-working / underperforming / actions, grounded in data citations
+ live research (web-search tool).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `GET` returns a best upload window from the creator's own activity data
- [x] Returns optimal long-form → Short gap when supported
- [x] Improvement brief cites specific data rows + current-format research; no generic advice
- [x] Disclaimer/honesty text present (structural test)

---

## Issue 13: Clip outcomes loop (strongest signal)
**Depends on**: 12

**What**: When a creator publishes a clip, capture its real-world performance via the API
and feed it back as the strongest positive label.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Published clip outcomes fetched and stored
- [x] Outcome feeds the preference model at the highest weight
- [x] Tests cover the outcome → model path

---

---

## BETA_DEPLOYMENT Phase (Issues 23–28)

Goal: app running at a real URL, accessible to a small group of close YouTube friends.
All code is written. These issues are infrastructure + configuration only.

---

## Issue 23: VM provisioning + Cloudflare DNS + HTTPS
**Depends on**: nothing (external setup)
**Status**: ✅ Done (production live on `autoclip.studio` via Cloudflare Tunnel)

**What**: Provision a cloud VM (DigitalOcean Droplet at `147.182.136.107`), install Docker
+ Docker Compose, point `autoclip.studio` at it via Cloudflare Tunnel (no open inbound
ports needed), and verify HTTPS is live.

**Steps**:
- SSH into the VM; install Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2
- Install `cloudflared`; authenticate and create a tunnel for `autoclip.studio`
- Configure Cloudflare DNS to route `autoclip.studio` → tunnel (CNAME, orange cloud)
- Write `docker-compose.prod.yml` cloudflared service (or run as systemd unit)
- Verify the app container listens on port 80 (already configured)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` starts all services without errors
- [ ] `https://autoclip.studio/health` returns `{status: ok, postgres: ok, redis: ok}` from public internet
- [ ] HTTPS terminates at Cloudflare; no direct port exposure on the VM (ports 80/443 not open)
- [ ] SSH access is key-only; password auth disabled

---

## Issue 24: Production environment configuration
**Depends on**: 23 (needs the domain for OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI and ALLOWED_ORIGINS)

**What**: Build the production `.env` file on the VM with all required secrets, lock CORS
and docs settings, and set GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD.

**Steps**:
- Copy `.env.example` → `.env` on the VM at `/opt/autoclip/`; fill every required field
- Generate `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`
- Generate `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- Set `ENV=production`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://autoclip.studio`, `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://autoclip.studio/auth/callback`
- Set `APP_BASE_URL=https://autoclip.studio`
- Confirm `/docs` is disabled (`ENV=production` already gates this in `main.py`)
- Set GitHub Actions secrets: `VPS_HOST`, `VPS_USER`, `VPS_SSH_KEY`, `VPS_PORT`, `GHCR_TOKEN`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] App starts with `ENV=production`; `/docs` returns 404
- [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is exactly `https://autoclip.studio` (no wildcard, no localhost)
- [ ] `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` are unique, random, and not committed to git
- [ ] `.env` is in `.gitignore` (verify)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (`deploy.yml`) succeeds end-to-end on a manual trigger

---

## Issue 25: External API services provisioning
**Depends on**: 24

**What**: Create accounts and provision API keys for every external service the app requires.
Verify all connections via `/health` and a real request.

**Services to provision**:
- **Anthropic**: API key → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **Voyage AI**: API key → `VOYAGE_API_KEY`
- **Deepgram**: API key → `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`; set `TRANSCRIPTION_BACKEND=deepgram`
- **Cloudflare R2**: bucket `creatorclip-beta`; generate R2 API token; fill `R2_ACCOUNT_ID=997799b711c382c4de3ab1501bd2751f`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET=creatorclip-beta`; set `STORAGE_BACKEND=r2`
- **Stripe**: live/test keys → `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `GET /health` reports all services healthy with real credentials in place
- [ ] Deepgram: a short test audio file transcribes successfully via the app
- [ ] R2: a test file upload + download succeeds via the storage client
- [ ] All API keys in `.env` on the VM only — none in git, none in logs

---

## Issue 26: Google OAuth consent screen + beta test users
**Depends on**: 23 (needs the production domain for the redirect URI)

**What**: Configure the Google Cloud project's OAuth consent screen for external users in
Testing status, add beta testers' Google accounts as test users, and verify the full
OAuth flow end-to-end against the production URL.

**Steps**:
- In Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen:
  - User type: **External**; Publishing status: **Testing** (stays in testing until public launch)
  - Add app name (`CreatorClip`), support email, and `autoclip.studio` as authorized domain
  - Add scopes: `youtube.readonly`, `yt-analytics.readonly`, `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile`
  - Add each beta tester's Gmail address under **Test users** (up to 100 allowed in Testing status)
- In Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs: confirm Authorized redirect URI includes `https://autoclip.studio/auth/callback`
- Verify `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env` match this project

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] At least 2 beta testers added as test users in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] OAuth consent screen shows app name and correct scopes
- [ ] Full OAuth flow works end-to-end: visit `https://autoclip.studio/auth/login` → Google consent → redirect back → creator record created in DB
- [ ] Protected routes return 401 without a session (verify with curl)
- [ ] Cross-creator isolation test passes on the live DB

---

## Issue 27: YouTube API quota check + backoff verification
**Depends on**: 25, 26

**What**: Confirm the project's YouTube API daily quota is sufficient for beta usage and
verify that the app's backoff + caching handles quota exhaustion gracefully.

**Steps**:
- Check Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Quotas for:
  - YouTube Data API v3 (default: 10,000 units/day)
  - YouTube Analytics API (default: varies)
- Calculate expected units per active user per day (catalog fetch + per-video metrics)
- Request a quota increase via Google Cloud Console if needed
- Simulate a 403 and confirm `analytics.py` retries with backoff
- Document quota limits and per-user unit cost in `docs/DECISIONS.md`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Quota limits documented with units-per-user estimate for beta
- [ ] Quota increase requested (or confirmed sufficient) before inviting friends
- [ ] 403 response from YouTube API triggers exponential backoff (test passes or manual verification)
- [ ] Quota headroom: at least 3× expected daily usage for beta group

---

## Issue 28: Beta go-live smoke test + friend onboarding
**Depends on**: 23–27

**What**: Run the full user journey end-to-end on the live deployment, then invite 2–3
close YouTube friends. Monitor logs for 48 hours before expanding the invite list.

**Pre-invite checklist**:
- [ ] Full pipeline smoke test: OAuth → link a video → ingest → transcribe → signals → DNA build → clip candidates → render → review UI
- [ ] Celery Beat tasks confirmed running: `purge_stale_source_media`, `refresh_youtube_analytics`, `poll_clip_outcomes`
- [ ] Rate limits verified live (hit the LLM rate limit endpoint; confirm 429 response)
- [ ] Account deletion flow works on the live DB
- [ ] `docker compose logs --tail 200 app worker` clean (no unhandled exceptions)
- [ ] Browser console clean on index, review, onboarding, and profile pages

**Onboarding**:
- [ ] Each friend added as a Google OAuth test user (Issue 26)
- [ ] Share URL + brief instructions (connect YouTube, wait for DNA build, try the review queue)
- [ ] Monitor logs for 48 hours; document any issues in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] At least 2 friends complete onboarding and generate their first clip candidates
- [ ] No data-isolation breach between creator accounts (verified in DB)
- [ ] No PII or tokens visible in logs
- [ ] BETA_DEPLOYMENT phase declared done in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`

---

## PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT Phase (Issues 29–30)

Goal: scalable, verified, publicly launchable infrastructure. Start after beta is stable.
K8s provider decided and Helm charts written (Issue 22 — GKE Autopilot + KEDA + PgBouncer).
Billing implemented (Issue 21 — minute packs + Stripe Checkout).

---

## Issue 29: Google OAuth app verification
**Depends on**: 28 (needs a stable production URL and privacy policy live)

**What**: Submit the Google OAuth consent screen for verification. Required to move from
Testing status (100-user limit) to Published (unlimited users).

**Steps**:
- Ensure TOS and Privacy Policy pages are live at `autoclip.studio` (already built — Issue 14)
- Prepare scope justification for each requested YouTube scope
- Submit for verification via Google Cloud Console → OAuth consent screen → Publish App
- Respond to Google review team requests (this process typically takes 1–4 weeks)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] App submitted for verification
- [ ] Publishing status changes from "Testing" to "In production"
- [ ] OAuth flow works for a Google account NOT in the test users list
- [ ] `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` Pre-Public-Launch Gates: Google OAuth verification checked off

---

## Issue 30: Production hardening + public go-live
**Depends on**: 29

**What**: Run the full pre-public-launch checklist, load test the K8s deployment, and
cut the first production release.

**Pre-launch gates** (all must be green):
- [ ] All items in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` Pre-Public-Launch Gates checked off
- [ ] Load test: simulate 50 concurrent users running the ingest → clip pipeline; p99 latency acceptable
- [ ] `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` rotation runbook tested end-to-end on staging
- [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` locked to production domain; `/docs` returns 404
- [ ] No virality promise in any UI or API response (structural test green)
- [ ] Monitoring + alerting live (Cloudflare Analytics + application-level error rate alert)
- [ ] Final security review: no PII in logs, no tokens in responses, per-creator isolation confirmed
- [ ] Account-deletion (right-to-erasure) tested on the production K8s environment

**Go-live**:
- [ ] `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` updated: PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT phase declared done
- [ ] `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` updated with the final production runbook
- [ ] Git tag: `v1.0.0`

---

## Issue 31: Operability kit — secrets registry, preflight doctor, deploy hardening, auto-heal
**Depends on**: nothing (cross-cuts the BETA phase)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-27)

**What**: Make secrets and deploys legible and reliable. A single secrets registry, a redacted
preflight validator, faster/more-consistent deploys, and container auto-recovery.

**Delivered**:
- `docs/SECRETS.md` — canonical registry of every secret/config value (what, where it lives, how
  to get/rotate) + the creatorclip/autoclip/agenticlip naming map.
- `scripts/doctor.py` (+ `tests/test_doctor.py`) — presence + format + live checks with redacted
  output; non-zero exit so it gates the deploy. `--full` / `--offline` / `--json` modes.
- `docs/ACCESS.md` — click-by-click SSH + CI deploy-key + Cloudflare Tunnel runbook (tailored to
  the droplet + autoclip.studio), with key inventory/consolidation steps.
- Deploy hardening — amd64-only image build; `deploy.yml` doctor preflight before migrate/cutover;
  job/domain naming reconciled.
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` — `cloudflared` service + no host port; app/worker healthchecks; dev
  `--reload` dropped; `willfarrell/autoheal` sidecar for restart-on-unhealthy.
- Bug fix — `routers/clips.py` stale `billing.tiers` import (app could not start) → minute-packs
  `check_positive_balance` guard.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Every secret documented in `docs/SECRETS.md` with location + how-to-obtain
- [x] `python scripts/doctor.py` reports per-secret status with values redacted; exits non-zero on failure
- [x] `docs/ACCESS.md` gives concrete SSH + tunnel steps for this infrastructure
- [x] Prod compose exposes no host port; `cloudflared` fronts the app; app/worker auto-heal on unhealthy
- [x] CI image builds amd64-only; deploy runs the doctor preflight before cutover
- [x] App imports and full suite green (`313 passed`)

## Phase 2: Hardening & Test Coverage (Issues 32–55)

Discovered in the **2026-05-28 project-wide audit** (router-by-router read, parallel
subagent reads of `worker/`, `billing/`, `clip_engine/`, `dna/`, `ingestion/`, `preference/`,
`youtube/`, `crypto.py`, `scripts/`, plus a test-coverage gap audit).

Same Check → Approve → Build → Review loop applies; **Phase 1 must research the current
industry standard** for each fix before changing code. Dependency-ordered. Severities:
**SEV-0** blocks the app or causes data loss / cross-creator leak;
**SEV-1** security, ToS, billing, or availability gap;
**SEV-2** robustness / race / completeness;
**TESTS** missing load-bearing coverage per the 80/20 + 100%-on-load-bearing target.

> **Coverage target**: ~80% line overall, **100% line + branch on load-bearing modules**
> (`auth.py`, `crypto.py`, `routers/auth.py`, `routers/billing.py`, `routers/clips.py` render
> path, `billing/ledger.py`, `billing/stripe_client.py`, `worker/tasks.py` ingest+render+outcomes,
> `clip_engine/scoring.py`, `clip_engine/candidates.py` setup-before-peak, `youtube/oauth.py`,
> `youtube/quota.py`, every per-creator-isolation path). Not 99% — the global CLAUDE.md
> 80/20 rule explicitly bans over-testing.

### Issue 32: Restore test suite — `starlette` / FastAPI version mismatch
**Severity**: SEV-0 — pytest cannot collect; deploy validation impossible
**Depends on**: nothing
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `python3.12 -m pytest -q` fails at import with
`TypeError: Router.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'on_startup'`.2
Cause: installed `starlette==1.1.0` (published under the new `Kludex/starlette` maintainership;
starlette graduated from ZeroVer to 1.0 on 2026-03-22 — a legitimate breaking release, not a
typosquat) is incompatible with FastAPI 0.115.x which forwards `on_startup`/`on_shutdown` to
starlette's Router. The 1.x line removed those kwargs.

**Files**: `requirements.txt`, plus a `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1 research: confirmed FastAPI 0.115.4's `Requires-Dist` is `starlette>=0.40.0,<0.42.0`; pinned `starlette==0.41.3` (highest within constraint); rejected uv/pip-tools migration as scope-creep for an SEV-0 hotfix
- [x] `requirements.txt` pins **both** fastapi and starlette explicitly with `==`
- [x] Fresh install in clean venv resolves to compatible versions
- [x] `pytest -q` collects and runs every test — **313 passed, 7 deselected** (the 7 are integration-marked, excluded by `pytest.ini`)
- [x] `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry — "2026-05-28 — Pin starlette explicitly to defend against transitive shadowing"
- [x] `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` updated with current pass count

---

### Issue 33: Cross-creator data leak in `/creators/me/improvement-brief`
**Severity**: SEV-0 — other creators' analytics sent to Claude for the requesting creator
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `routers/improvement.py:28` ran `select(VideoMetrics).limit(50)` with **no
`creator_id` filter**. The averages built at lines 30–43 and embedded in the Claude prompt
mixed all creators' data into one creator's brief.

**Files**: `routers/improvement.py`, `tests/test_improvement_isolation.py` (new),
`docs/COMPLIANCE.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Query is `select(VideoMetrics).join(Video).where(Video.creator_id == creator.id).order_by(VideoMetrics.fetched_at.desc()).limit(50)` — ORDER BY added for determinism (was non-deterministic too)
- [x] Integration test (real Postgres): seeds creator A (avg_views=1,000, 5 videos) + creator B (avg_views=999,999, 5 videos); asserts creator A's analytics dict to Claude receives `videos_in_db=5` and `avg_views≈1,000` (not 10 / not 500,500 / not 999,999)
- [x] Second integration test: zero-data creator → HTTP 400 `"Not enough data — link some videos first."` instead of feeding `None` averages to Claude
- [x] `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` "Findings & Fixes Log" section added with the 2026-05-28 entry
- [x] Defense-in-depth RLS follow-up filed as **Issue 56** below
- ~~Audit-log entry on every improvement-brief call~~ — **dropped in Phase 1 brief**: audit-log-per-LLM-call is observability, not security. The security guarantee is the filter + the test. Adding rows to `audit_log` (currently reserved for security-critical events like `creator.deleted`) would dilute the table without strengthening isolation. If LLM observability is needed, do it uniformly across all LLM endpoints in a separate issue.

---

### Issue 34: Idempotent minute deduction on Celery retry
**Severity**: SEV-0 — billing double-charge on transient ingest failures
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `worker/tasks.py:189` called `deduct_minutes` inside `_ingest_async` with no
per-video key. Celery's at-least-once delivery (`task_acks_late=True` + worker-crash-before-ack)
could re-run ingest and re-decrement the balance, charging up to 4× per video.

**Files**: `models.py`, `alembic/versions/0003_minute_deductions.py` (new), `billing/ledger.py`,
`worker/tasks.py`, `tests/test_billing.py`, `tests/test_billing_idempotency.py` (new),
`docs/SOT.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Resolution chose a ledger table over a column** for symmetry with the existing
`MinutePack` grants ledger and to enable a real billing-history surface later.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: confirmed industry standard — Stripe `Idempotency-Key` pattern + Postgres `UNIQUE` constraint + SAVEPOINT for atomic two-write (see `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-28 entry on Issue 34)
- [x] New `MinuteDeduction` model + `0003_minute_deductions.py` migration with `UNIQUE(video_id)` idempotency key + `(creator_id, deducted_at)` index for usage queries
- [x] `deduct_for_video(video_id, creator_id, duration_s, session)` uses fast-path existence check, then SAVEPOINT-wrapped INSERT + atomic balance `WHERE balance >= n RETURNING`; rolls back on insufficient balance OR concurrent `IntegrityError`
- [x] 4 integration tests against real Postgres: sequential retry idempotency, two-coroutine concurrent race, 402-leaves-ledger-clean, audit fields persisted
- [x] `docs/SOT.md` data model section updated; `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry written
- [x] `tests/test_billing.py` mocked unit tests of the old `deduct_minutes` removed (replaced by real-DB integration tests — see comment block in the file)
- [x] Refund-on-terminal-failure spawned as new **Issue 57** below

---

### Issue 35: Idempotent DNA build — prevent orphan draft accumulation
**Severity**: SEV-0 — versioned DNA table accumulates orphans on Celery retry
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `_build_dna_async` (worker/tasks.py:127–139) commits a draft via `dna/profile.create_draft`
then makes Voyage embedding + Anthropic brief calls. If anything after the draft commit
fails, Celery retries the whole task and `create_draft` inserts another row at version+1,
leaving the previous draft as orphan.

**Files**: `worker/tasks.py:127–139`, `dna/profile.py:30–60`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Either: (a) all draft + embedding + brief writes occur in one transaction, committed at the end; OR (b) task checks for an existing draft for this build-attempt-id before inserting
- [ ] Integration test: force a Voyage failure mid-build; on retry exactly one draft row exists
- [ ] `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry

---

### Issue 36: OAuth token lifecycle hardening
**Severity**: SEV-1 — zombie tokens, wasted quota, incomplete ToS revocation
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Three related lifecycle gaps:
1. `routers/auth.py:140–157 delete_account` revokes only the **access_token** at Google; the **refresh_token** stays valid until the user manually disconnects in their Google Account.
2. `youtube/oauth.py:206–210 refresh_access_token` doesn't delete the `YoutubeToken` row on Google `invalid_grant` (HTTP 400 at refresh).
3. `youtube/data_api.py:55–76` and `youtube/analytics.py:42–57` retry-with-backoff on **every 403** regardless of whether `error.errors[].reason` is `quotaExceeded` (transient) or `authError`/`forbidden` (permanent). The beat loop keeps hitting Google for revoked creators forever.

**Files**: `routers/auth.py:140–157`, `youtube/oauth.py:201–230`, `youtube/data_api.py:55–76`, `youtube/analytics.py:42–57`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `delete_account` revokes the refresh_token via `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke?token=<refresh>`; tolerates 400 `token_revoked`/`invalid_token` as success
- [x] `refresh_access_token` deletes the `YoutubeToken` row + commits on Google `invalid_grant`
- [x] `data_api` / `analytics` inspect the response body and only retry `quotaExceeded`; on auth-error 403 raise a typed exception so the worker can clean up the token + mark creator disconnected
- [x] Tests for all three branches with mocked Google responses

**Implementation**: New `youtube/errors.py` (`YouTubeAuthError` + reason sets). See `docs/DECISIONS.md` (2026-05-28 — Issue 36). "Mark creator disconnected" is implemented as deletion of the `YoutubeToken` row, not a new `OnboardingState` value.

### Issue 37: External SDK timeouts + retry-with-backoff
**Severity**: SEV-1 — worker hangs on a stuck remote call
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Anthropic, Stripe, Voyage, Deepgram, R2 (boto3) clients are constructed per-call
with no `timeout=` and no retry policy. Each SDK call can hang the worker indefinitely.

**Files**: `clip_engine/scoring.py:181`, `dna/brief.py:43–50`, `improvement/brief.py:48–55`,
`dna/embeddings.py:50,74`, `ingestion/transcribe.py:44–48`, `billing/stripe_client.py:19–20`,
`worker/storage.py:34–42`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Phase 1 (per `/claude-api` skill): research Anthropic SDK recommended `timeout=` / `max_retries=`; same for Stripe (`max_network_retries`), boto3 adaptive retry, Voyage tenacity-wrap, Deepgram httpx timeout
- [ ] Module-level singleton per SDK, constructed once from `config.settings`
- [ ] Per-call timeout override for known-long calls (improvement_brief with web_search may need 120s)
- [ ] Test that asserts each client config has a positive timeout

### Issue 38: Sync external calls inside `async def` + held DB sessions
**Severity**: SEV-1 — DB connection pool starvation under LLM load
**Depends on**: 32, 37
**Status**: ✅ Wave 1 Done (2026-05-28) — Wave 2 tracked as Issue 82

**What**: Sync calls (sync Anthropic, sync Voyage, sync Deepgram, boto3, subprocess) run
inside `async def` while an AsyncSession is open. The connection is pinned for the entire
LLM round-trip (often 10–40 s). Under any concurrent load this exhausts the pool.

**Scope split (2026-05-28)**: a full-codebase audit found 23 instances across both
class (1) sync-in-async and class (2) await-while-session-open patterns. Split into
two waves to keep PRs reviewable:

- **Wave 1 (this issue)** — Celery hot-path class (1) fixes. ✅ Done.
- **Wave 2 (Issue 82)** — AsyncAnthropic / AsyncVoyage migration in `dna/brief.py`,
  `improvement/brief.py`, `clip_engine/ranking.py`; router session-order refactor in
  `routers/auth.py`, `routers/videos.py`, `routers/clips.py`; the load test.

**Files (Wave 1)**: `worker/storage.py` (new async wrappers — `aupload_file`,
`adelete_file`, `adelete_prefix`, `alocal_path`); `worker/tasks.py`
(`_ingest_async` / `_transcribe_async` / `_signals_async` / `_render_clip_async` /
`_build_dna_async` / `_purge_stale_source_media_async` — sync calls offloaded via
`asyncio.to_thread`); `dna/embeddings.py` (`_aembed` wrapper); `tests/test_retention_tasks.py`
(patches updated for new async surface); `tests/test_worker_pipeline.py` (Issue 52
integration test patches updated for `alocal_path`).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Sync calls in the Celery ingest pipeline wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` (Wave 1: probe_duration_s, extract_audio_wav, transcribe_audio, extract_audio_events, render_clip_file, upload_file, delete_file, Voyage `_embed`, sync Anthropic `generate_brief`)
- [→] Where Anthropic supports it, switch to `AsyncAnthropic` → **tracked as Issue 82**
- [→] Load test: 10 concurrent improvement-brief calls do not exhaust the connection pool → **tracked as Issue 82** (depends on routers/improvement.py refactor which is also in Wave 2)

---

### Issue 39: Celery event-loop strategy
**Severity**: SEV-1 — pool churn + `Future attached to a different loop` errors under load
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Every Celery task body calls `asyncio.run(...)`, spinning up a fresh event loop
and binding the SQLAlchemy async engine pool to whichever loop touched it first. Under
concurrency this causes connection-pool churn and the "Future attached to a different loop"
class of bugs.

**Files**: `worker/tasks.py:50,60,70,82,92,105,114,124,134`, `db.py:8`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research current best practice (celery-pool-asyncio, asgiref.async_to_sync, per-worker-process singleton loop)
- [x] Single shared loop per worker process OR per-worker engine that is bound at worker init
- [x] `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry with the chosen pattern + tradeoffs

---

### Issue 40: Streaming upload + DoS guard
**Severity**: SEV-1 — up to 500 MB into memory per upload request
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `routers/videos.py:90` reads `await file.read(max_bytes + 1)` — loads the entire
upload into RAM before validating size.

**Files**: `routers/videos.py:77–129`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Upload streams to a temp file in fixed chunks (e.g., 1 MB) with running byte-count check
- [ ] 413 returned as soon as max size is exceeded; partial upload deleted
- [ ] Test that the API container's RSS does not balloon for a rejected oversized upload

---

### Issue 41: Replace pickle in preference model (RCE surface)
**Severity**: SEV-1 — `pickle.loads()` from a DB blob = RCE if blob is ever attacker-controlled
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done

**What**: `preference/model.py:39–40` calls `pickle.loads(weights_blob)` on
`preference_models.weights_blob`. Any future write path to that column (admin import, SQL
injection elsewhere, a bug) becomes RCE in the worker.

**Files**: `preference/model.py`, `models.py PreferenceModel`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Replace pickle with joblib + allowlist, sklearn JSON, or LightGBM native `.txt` format
- [x] If pickle truly cannot be removed, wrap the blob in an HMAC envelope (key in env) and verify before load
- [x] Test that a tampered blob is rejected

---

### Issue 42: ffmpeg / subprocess timeouts
**Severity**: SEV-1 — corrupt source file hangs a worker forever
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `clip_engine/render.py:22–24, 49–63` call `subprocess.run(cmd, ...)` with no
`timeout=`. A malformed source video can stall ffmpeg until the Celery hard timeout (if
configured) — or indefinitely (if not).

**Files**: `clip_engine/render.py:22, 49`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Every `subprocess.run` gets `timeout=max(120, clip_length_s * 4)`
- [x] `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` caught and surfaced as render `failed`
- [x] Test with a fake `sleep`-ing ffmpeg confirms the timeout fires

---

### Issue 43: Source-media purge correctness
**Severity**: SEV-1 — in-progress ingest can have its source deleted out from under it
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `_purge_stale_source_media_async` (worker/tasks.py:471–503) filters by
`Video.created_at < cutoff`. A long-pending or in-progress ingest of an old upload will
have its source purged mid-pipeline.

**Files**: `worker/tasks.py:471–503`, `models.py Video` (new column + migration).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `Video.ingest_done_at: datetime | None` column + migration; set on successful ingest
- [x] Purge filter uses `ingest_done_at IS NOT NULL AND ingest_done_at < cutoff`
- [x] Test: video created 100h ago, `ingest_done_at = NULL` → NOT purged; video done 100h ago → purged

---

### Issue 44: Auth boundary hardening
**Severity**: SEV-1 — 500 disclosure, deletion DoS surface, no zero-downtime key rotation
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Three related fixes:
1. `auth.py:43` — `uuid.UUID(payload["sub"])` raises `ValueError` on malformed sub → 500 (with stack trace in dev `ENV`).
2. `routers/auth.py:130 DELETE /me` — **no rate limit** on right-to-erasure.
3. `crypto.py:6–15` — single `Fernet`; no `MultiFernet` for zero-downtime rotation; `decrypt()` raises raw `InvalidToken` that callers handle inconsistently.

**Files**: `auth.py:43`, `routers/auth.py:130`, `crypto.py:6–15`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `get_current_creator` returns 401 (not 500) for any sub parse failure
- [ ] `DELETE /me` has `@limiter.limit("5/hour")`
- [ ] `crypto.py` switches to `MultiFernet([primary, previous])` keyed on `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` + new `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS`
- [ ] `decrypt()` wraps `InvalidToken` in a typed `TokenDecryptError`
- [ ] Tests for all three branches

---

### Issue 45: Concurrent token refresh lock + Redis pool
**Severity**: SEV-2 — refresh-token race; per-call aioredis connections
**Depends on**: 32, 36
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**:
- `youtube/oauth.py:201` — two concurrent worker tasks can race a refresh; Google rotates the refresh_token on some flows, so last-write-wins can invalidate the in-flight token.
- `youtube/quota.py:64` — `aioredis.from_url(...)` opens a new connection per `consume()` call.

**Files**: `youtube/oauth.py:201`, `youtube/quota.py:64`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Per-creator Redis advisory lock around the refresh branch (`SET NX` with 10 s TTL)
- [ ] Module-level singleton aioredis pool for quota
- [ ] Tests with two concurrent refreshes assert only one Google call

---

### Issue 46: Generate-clips retry safety + outcomes time-window bug
**Severity**: SEV-2 — stale retry wipes rendered clips; outcomes query grows forever
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**:
- `worker/tasks.py:78–85` retries `generate_clips`, which calls `ranking.py:89` `DELETE FROM clips WHERE video_id = ...`. A stale retry from an old failed task wipes already-rendered clips.
- `worker/tasks.py:367–431` defines `cutoff_48h` but the actual WHERE only uses `cutoff_7d`; the query refetches every clip past 7d on every hourly run forever.

**Files**: `worker/tasks.py:78–85, 367–431`, `clip_engine/ranking.py:89`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Generate-clips guards on `Clip.render_status != RenderStatus.done` before delete (DELETE excludes both `done` and `running`; idempotency early-return in `_generate_clips_async` if any `done` clip already exists for the video)
- [x] Poll-outcomes WHERE bounds: `Clip.created_at > now() - interval '30 days'`
- [x] Tests for both regressions (2 unit predicates in `tests/test_outcomes.py`; 3 integration tests in `tests/test_generate_clips_retry_integration.py`)

---

### Issue 47: Beat-job fairness on quota exhaustion
**Severity**: SEV-2 — first-by-id creators starve later ones forever
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `_refresh_youtube_analytics_async` iterates creators in `id` order, breaks on
`QuotaExhaustedError`; next day's run starts from the same order, perpetually starving later
creators.

**Files**: `worker/tasks.py:506–549, 367–431`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Order by `Creator.last_analytics_refreshed_at NULLS FIRST` (new column + migration)
- [x] On quota exhaustion the loop records progress and resumes from the unrefreshed slice
- [x] Test: 5 creators, quota cap of 2; over 3 runs all 5 refresh

---

### Issue 48: Per-creator isolation tests across all protected routes
**Severity**: TESTS — load-bearing isolation guarantee
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Only 3 of ~12 protected routes have an explicit cross-creator isolation test.

**Files**: `tests/test_isolation.py` (new; integration-marked, uses real Postgres).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Cover: `GET /videos`, `POST /videos/link`, `POST /videos/upload`, `GET /videos/{id}/status`, `POST /videos/{id}/clips/generate`, `GET /videos/{id}/clips`, `GET /clips/{id}`, `POST /clips/{id}/render`, `POST /clips/{id}/feedback`, `GET /creators/me/dna`, `POST /creators/me/dna/confirm`, `GET /creators/me/upload-intel`, `GET /creators/me/improvement-brief`, `GET /billing/balance`
- [ ] Each: seed creators A and B, assert A authenticated cannot read/modify B's row — 404 (never 200 with sanitized data)
- [ ] Run under docker-compose real Postgres

---

### Issue 49: Billing race + Stripe webhook idempotency against real Postgres
**Severity**: TESTS — load-bearing money path
**Depends on**: 32, 34
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Existing `test_billing.py` uses `AsyncMock` for sessions; SEV-0 "double-deduct"
and "double-fulfill" cases cannot be caught.

**Files**: `tests/test_billing_integration.py` (new), real Postgres.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Two concurrent `deduct_minutes` calls on a balance < their combined need — exactly one succeeds, the other 402s
- [ ] Stripe webhook called twice with the same `stripe_session_id` — `MinutePack` ledger has exactly one row
- [ ] Webhook with unknown `pack_id` — no ledger row
- [ ] Webhook with missing metadata — no ledger row

---

### Issue 50: Account-deletion cascade tests against real Postgres
**Severity**: TESTS — load-bearing privacy / right-to-erasure
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `test_account_deletion.py` uses MagicMock; FK cascade behavior is never verified.
A weakened cascade in a future migration would silently leave PII behind.

**Files**: `tests/test_account_deletion_integration.py` (new) or expand existing.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Real Postgres: seed creator with rows in every dependent table (`YoutubeToken`, `Video`, `VideoMetrics`, `Clip`, `ClipFeedback`, `ClipOutcome`, `RetentionCurve`, `AudienceActivity`, `Demographics`, `Transcript`, `Signals`, `CreatorDna`, `DnaEmbedding`, `PreferenceModel`, `MinutePack`, `Usage`)
- [ ] After `DELETE /me`: every dependent table has zero rows for that creator_id
- [ ] Audit-log row recorded
- [ ] Storage purge called for `source/` AND `clips/` prefixes
- [ ] Google revoke failure path: deletion still succeeds; audit + cascade still occur

---

### Issue 51: OAuth lifecycle tests
**Severity**: TESTS — load-bearing auth + ToS
**Depends on**: 32, 36
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**Files**: `tests/test_oauth_lifecycle.py` (new).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Token <5 min from expiry triggers refresh, persists re-encrypted blob, returns new access_token
- [ ] Google 400 `invalid_grant` → YoutubeToken row deleted, 401 raised
- [ ] Google 403 `quotaExceeded` → backoff and retry
- [ ] Google 403 `authError` → token deleted, no retry
- [ ] OAuth callback logs at INFO and DEBUG contain neither access_token nor refresh_token (use `caplog`)
- [ ] Authorization URL requests exactly the four documented scopes; no `youtube.upload`

---

### Issue 52: Worker pipeline integration tests
**Severity**: TESTS — load-bearing pipeline
**Depends on**: 32, 34, 39
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `_ingest_async`, `_transcribe_async`, `_signals_async`, `_render_clip_async`,
`_generate_clips_async`, `_build_dna_async`, `_poll_clip_outcomes_async` have no direct
tests; `test_pipeline_trigger.py` calls the mock itself rather than the real task.

**Files**: `tests/test_worker_pipeline.py` (new) — 5 integration tests against real
Postgres, mocks at the storage / external-SDK boundary per the established codebase
pattern (no real fixture media files needed; `local_path` is mocked to yield a temp
file, external SDKs mocked at their entry points). No Celery eager mode needed —
direct `await _<task>_async(...)` invocation matches the pattern in
`test_dna_build_idempotency.py` / `test_generate_clips_retry_integration.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Ingest task → storage + DB state correct, minutes deducted exactly once (2 invocations → 1 `MinuteDeduction` row, balance decremented by ceil(duration/60))
- [x] Render task retried 3× → `render_uri` set, `render_status=done`, exactly 1 Clip row
- [x] generate_clips retried after partial success → done clip preserved, no new pending rows (covers Issue 46 idempotency guard end-to-end with Signals + Transcript context)
- [x] poll_clip_outcomes computes `performed_well` against per-creator median, NOT global (Creator A median=500 → False; Creator B median=20 → True; both fed the same fetched views=100; global median would label both identically)
- [x] build_dna below `MIN_VIDEOS_FOR_DNA` → `ValueError` propagates, no `CreatorDna` draft row created (task wrapper at `worker/tasks.py:184-196` re-raises ValueError without `self.retry` — pinned by inspection; integration test calls `_build_dna_async` directly per existing `test_dna_build_idempotency.py` pattern)

---

### Issue 53: Compliance structural scan — no virality across all surfaces
**Severity**: TESTS — load-bearing honesty / ToS
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `tests/test_compliance.py` is misnamed — it actually covers retention tasks. The
"no response promises virality" constraint is asserted only in two LLM-output paths. Need a
structural scan across every JSON response, every static HTML/CSS/JS, every Pydantic schema
description.

**Files**: rename existing `tests/test_compliance.py` → `tests/test_retention_tasks.py`;
add new `tests/test_compliance_no_virality.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Walk every public route from the OpenAPI schema; hit each with an authed test creator; assert no response body contains `viral`, `virality`, `guaranteed views`, `promise`
- [ ] Same scan across every file under `static/` and every Pydantic schema description in the OpenAPI doc
- [ ] Whitelist the named principle `Audience-fit over generic virality` by exact-match exclusion

---

### Issue 54: `scripts/rotate_token_key.py` integration test
**Severity**: TESTS — pre-public-launch gate
**Depends on**: 32, 44
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**Files**: `tests/test_rotate_token_key.py` (new), real Postgres.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Seed `YoutubeToken` rows encrypted with key A; run rotate A → B; assert all rows decrypt with B
- [ ] Inject a corrupted ciphertext mid-run; script rolls back, exits non-zero, zero rows mutated
- [ ] Script logs never contain plaintext token (verify with `caplog`)

---

### Issue 55: Bundled load-bearing test gaps
**Severity**: TESTS
**Depends on**: 32
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Cluster of smaller load-bearing assertions, one test each — appended to the
existing test files rather than a new file per item.

**Acceptance criteria** (each item = one test):
- [ ] `auth.get_current_creator` returns 401 (not 500) when JWT sub UUID points to a creator deleted after token issuance
- [ ] `clip_engine.scoring.score_candidates` clamps Claude scores outside `[0, 1]`
- [ ] `routers.billing.checkout` returns 503 when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is empty
- [ ] `dna.profile.confirm_draft` supersedes the previously confirmed profile (only one row in `confirmed` after confirm)
- [ ] `routers.videos.upload_video` rejects with 413 a file just over `UPLOAD_MAX_MB` and writes nothing to storage
- [ ] `preference.train.build_and_save` excludes `skip` feedback, includes `trim` as positive, weights `performed_well=True` rows 3×
- [ ] Account deletion writes audit log row even when storage purge raises
- [ ] `youtube.quota.consume` raises (not silent-allows) when Redis is unreachable
- [ ] Adversarial clip-engine eval: "loud aftermath" scenario asserts `setup_start_s` precedes the climax, not the post-peak laugh

### Issue 56: Evaluate Postgres Row-Level Security for tenant-owned tables
**Severity**: SEV-2 — defense-in-depth against future missed creator_id filters
**Depends on**: 32, 48
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28) — decision: **adopt now**; implementation tracked as new Issue 79

**What**: The current isolation model is application-layer always-filter — every protected
query carries `where(creator_id == ...)`. This is the 2026 industry-standard foundation,
but it failed once already (Issue 33: a missed filter leaked cross-creator analytics into
a Claude prompt). Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS) is the recommended defense-in-depth
"safety net underneath" the application filter: the database refuses to return cross-tenant
rows even when application code forgets the WHERE.

This is a **research-and-decide** issue, not a foregone implementation. The trade-offs
(per the 2026 industry surveys cited in `docs/COMPLIANCE.md`'s 2026-05-28 entry) are real:

- **Pros**: structural guarantee against missed-filter regressions; AWS / PlanetScale /
  techbuddies all recommend it for compliance-sensitive multi-tenant SaaS; properly indexed,
  it has no measurable perf cost vs. application filtering.
- **Cons**: requires `SET LOCAL app.creator_id = ...` middleware at request entry,
  alembic `CREATE POLICY` DDL on every tenant-owned table, BYPASSRLS lockdown on the
  migration role, and RLS-aware integration tests (the Issue 48 prototype needs to verify
  that with RLS enabled, an *unfiltered* query in test code also returns zero rows).

**Files (if we proceed)**: new alembic migration, request-entry middleware in `main.py`,
RLS-aware test updates, `docs/SOT.md` + `docs/DECISIONS.md` + `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` entries.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research current production patterns for RLS + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + async (pgbouncer compatibility pinned in DECISIONS: safe with transaction pooling, unsafe with statement pooling; we don't run pgbouncer today)
- [x] Decision documented in `docs/DECISIONS.md`: **adopt now**
- [→] If adopted: RLS policies cover every table with a `creator_id` column; migration role retains BYPASSRLS for alembic upgrades → **tracked as Issue 79**
- [→] If adopted: Issue 48 isolation tests extended to assert "unfiltered query returns zero rows for non-current creator" → **tracked as Issue 79**

---

### Issue 57: Refund on terminal ingest failure
**Severity**: SEV-2 — creator paid for a permanently-failed ingest
**Depends on**: 34
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Issue 34 made minute deduction per-video-idempotent — the creator can no longer
be double-charged. But if `_ingest_async` deducts minutes and then ingest fails on every
Celery retry (max_retries=3 → 4 total attempts), the deduction sticks for a permanently-
failed ingest. The product needs a policy for this.

**Policy decided (2026-05-28 — see `docs/DECISIONS.md`)**:
- Automatic refund (no human gate)
- All terminal failures regardless of cause
- Surfaced via billing-history `MinutePack` row only; email + in-app banner split into
  new Issues 58 + 59 (require infrastructure we don't have yet)

**Files**: `billing/refund.py` (new — refund helper), `worker/tasks.py`
(`RefundOnFailureTask` base class applied to ingest_video, transcribe_video, build_signals),
`tests/test_billing_refund.py` (unit), `tests/test_billing_refund_integration.py`
(integration), `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` (new "Billing & Refund Policy" section).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: decide refund policy + UX surface; document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] Celery `on_failure` hook (after final retry) refunds via
      `grant_minutes(..., reason="refund", pack_id=f"refund:{video_id}")` — idempotent
      via read-then-write check on `pack_id`
- [x] Integration test: ingest fails terminally → 1 `MinuteDeduction` row + 1 refund
      `MinutePack` row → net balance change = 0
- [x] User-visible disclosure of refund policy in `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` (canonical home
      until TOS / pricing pages land in Phase 3)

---

### Issue 80: Transactional email infrastructure
**Severity**: FEATURE — enables refund email + future password-reset / verification / launch comms
**Depends on**: 57
**Status**: 🔲 Not started

**What**: We have zero email infrastructure. The first consumer is the refund-success email
deferred from Issue 57; the next consumers are password reset, email verification,
quota-warning, and launch comms.

**Open questions to research / decide in Phase 1**:
- Provider: Resend (recommended — modern API, cheap, good Python SDK) vs. Sendgrid /
  Postmark / Amazon SES?
- Templating: inline Python f-strings (KISS for v1), Jinja2 templates, or MJML for
  responsive HTML?
- DKIM / SPF / DMARC setup on `autoclip.studio`?
- Local-dev path: console-sink the email body, or use Resend's sandbox mode?
- Idempotency keys on outbound sends (avoid duplicate refund emails on retry)?

**Files (if we proceed)**: `notify/mailer.py` (new), `notify/templates/refund.txt|.html`
(new), `worker/tasks.py` (extend `RefundOnFailureTask.on_failure` to enqueue a
`send_refund_email` task), `tests/test_mailer.py` (new), `.env.example`
(`RESEND_API_KEY`, `FROM_EMAIL`).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Phase 1: pick provider + templating approach; document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [ ] Mailer module with a typed send-email API and unit-test coverage
- [ ] Refund-success email wired and triggered from `RefundOnFailureTask.on_failure`
- [ ] Local-dev sink (console or sandbox) so tests don't hit the real provider
- [ ] `docs/SECRETS.md` updated with the new env vars

---

### Issue 81: In-app notifications surface
**Severity**: FEATURE — enables refund banner + future deploy notices / quota warnings
**Depends on**: 57
**Status**: 🔲 Not started

**What**: We have no notifications system. The first consumer is the refund-success banner
deferred from Issue 57; future consumers include scheduled-maintenance notices, quota
warnings, "your trial expires in N days", and YouTube re-auth prompts.

**Open questions to research / decide in Phase 1**:
- Storage model: dedicated `notifications` table vs. a generic
  `creator_events` log we can also use for analytics?
- Delivery model: poll (`GET /api/notifications` on page load) vs. SSE / WebSocket push?
  v1 poll is fine; push is a Phase 3 lift.
- Read/dismiss state: per-notification `seen_at` timestamp + per-creator `dismissed_at`?
- UI shape: persistent banner at the top of `/dashboard`, toast on first-load only, or
  inbox-style notification center?

**Files (if we proceed)**: new alembic migration adding `notifications` table,
`models.py` (Notification model), `routers/notifications.py` (new),
`static/notifications.js` (new), `tests/test_notifications.py` (new), `worker/tasks.py`
(`RefundOnFailureTask.on_failure` adds an emit call alongside the refund).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Phase 1: pick storage + delivery model; document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [ ] `notifications` table + alembic migration
- [ ] `GET /api/notifications` + `POST /api/notifications/:id/dismiss` endpoints
- [ ] Dashboard renders pending notifications as a dismissible banner
- [ ] Refund event emits a notification when an ingest is terminally refunded

### Issue 82: Issue 38 Wave 2 — AsyncAnthropic + AsyncVoyage migration + router session-order refactor
**Severity**: SEV-2 — closes remaining ~9 of 23 findings from the Issue 38 audit; pool starvation under web-request load
**Depends on**: 38 ✅ (Wave 1)
**Status**: 🔲 Not started

**What**: Wave 2 of the async-correctness work split from Issue 38. Closes the
findings that require an SDK swap (sync Anthropic → `AsyncAnthropic`, sync Voyage →
async-native if available, otherwise keep the `_aembed` thread wrap) and the router
session-order refactors where the FastAPI request session is held through external
HTTP calls.

Findings carry-over from Issue 38 audit:
- **AsyncAnthropic migration**: `dna/brief.py` (`_ANTHROPIC` singleton + `generate_brief`),
  `improvement/brief.py` (`_ANTHROPIC` + `generate_improvement_brief`); `clip_engine/scoring.py`
  if it uses sync Anthropic.
- **Router session-order**: `routers/auth.py` (`/callback` holds session through 3 Google
  HTTP round-trips; `delete_account` holds session through Google revoke + boto3 prefix delete);
  `routers/videos.py:upload_video` (holds session through stream + boto3 upload);
  `routers/clips.py:generate_clips` (holds request-scoped session through LLM scoring);
  `routers/billing.py:checkout` (sync Stripe call).
- **clip_engine/ranking.py**: `generate_and_rank_clips` holds session through async LLM scoring —
  refactor into `score_and_rank` + `persist_ranked_clips` so callers can release session during
  the LLM phase.
- **Load test (carry-over Issue 38 AC)**: 10 concurrent `/creators/me/improvement-brief` calls
  must not exhaust the DB connection pool.

**Files (if we proceed)**: `dna/brief.py`, `improvement/brief.py`, `clip_engine/ranking.py`,
`clip_engine/scoring.py`, `routers/auth.py`, `routers/videos.py`, `routers/clips.py`,
`routers/billing.py`, new `tests/test_pool_starvation_load.py`,
`docs/DECISIONS.md` (entry for the AsyncAnthropic migration choice + Stripe sync-call disposition).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] All Anthropic call sites use `AsyncAnthropic`; sync `Anthropic` import removed
- [ ] All routers acquire the DB session AFTER any external HTTP / LLM round-trip — read inputs first, close, then call
- [ ] `clip_engine/ranking.py` split into compute-phase (no session) + persist-phase (own session)
- [ ] Load test: 10 concurrent improvement-brief calls under default pool size produce zero pool-exhaustion errors

### Issue 79: Implement Postgres Row-Level Security per Issue 56 decision
**Severity**: SEV-2 — structural defense-in-depth against cross-tenant leaks
**Depends on**: 56 ✅
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Implement the RLS adopt-now decision from Issue 56. See
`docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-28 entry on Issue 56 for the full implementation
sketch (table list, role split, SET LOCAL injection point, FORCE RLS,
pgbouncer-future compatibility, silent UPDATE/DELETE gotchas).

**Files (if we proceed)**: new alembic migration (CREATE POLICY on 12
tables + FORCE RLS + role grants), `db.py` (after_begin event listener
sourcing `current_creator` from FastAPI context), `config.py` +
`.env.example` (new `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`), `alembic/env.py` (use the
migration URL), `routers/*.py` (audit every UPDATE/DELETE for rowcount
checks), `tests/test_isolation.py` (extend per AC4),
`docs/SOT.md` + `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (role-split runbook).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Alembic migration creates SELECT policies on all 12 tables listed in
      Issue 56's DECISIONS entry; `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on each
      (alembic revision `0010_rls_policies`)
- [x] Role split: `creatorclip_app` (no BYPASSRLS, not table owner);
      `creatorclip_migrate` with BYPASSRLS; new env var
      `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` documented in `docs/SECRETS.md`
- [x] `after_begin` event listener on `Session` sources `current_creator`
      from FastAPI request context (via `session.info["creator_id"]` set in
      `auth.py:get_current_creator`) and emits `SET LOCAL app.creator_id`
- [x] Every UPDATE / DELETE that targets a tenant-owned table checks
      `result.rowcount` and raises 404 on 0 — satisfied by construction
      (existing `session.get → mutate → commit` pattern + the two raw
      mutations targeting the exempt `creators` table). See DECISIONS entry
      for the audit summary.
- [x] Issue 48 isolation tests extended: with RLS active and Creator A in
      context, an unfiltered `SELECT * FROM <each table>` returns zero
      Creator B rows
- [x] Production runbook in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` covers the one-time
      `BYPASSRLS` grant on the migration role (plus passwords + ownership
      transfer + pgbouncer-future caveat)
- [x] No regression in existing test suite (381 passed, 1 skipped,
      56 deselected — +2 RLS integration tests)

### Phase 2 close-out gates

- [ ] Every SEV-0 and SEV-1 issue above resolved (32–47)
- [ ] Overall `pytest --cov` line coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] Load-bearing modules (listed at top of Phase 2) ≥ 95% line + 100% branch
- [ ] Phase 2 declared done in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- [ ] `docs/DECISIONS.md` updated for every implementation choice that diverged from the obvious path
## Issue 35: Idempotent DNA build (SEV-0)
**Depends on**: 6
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: `_build_dna_async` committed the draft row inside `create_draft`, then made Voyage
embedding calls. On retry, `create_draft` inserted another row at version+1, leaving the prior
draft as an orphan. Fix: defer commit until all writes (draft + embeddings + onboarding state)
are staged, then flush atomically.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] All draft + embedding + brief writes occur in one transaction, committed at the end
- [x] Integration test: force a Voyage failure mid-build; on retry exactly one draft row exists
- [x] `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry (2026-05-28)
- [x] Upload streams to a temp file in fixed chunks (e.g., 1 MB) with running byte-count check
- [x] 413 returned as soon as max size is exceeded; partial upload deleted
- [x] Test that the API container's RSS does not balloon for a rejected oversized upload
## Issue 44: Auth boundary hardening (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: 3, 18, 19
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-28)

**What**: Three security sub-fixes: (1) malformed JWT `sub` returns 401 not 500,
(2) `DELETE /me` rate-limited to 5/hour, (3) `crypto.py` MultiFernet + typed exception.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Malformed sub → 401 (not 500); test asserts
- [x] 6th `DELETE /me` in an hour → 429; test asserts rate limit registered
- [x] Encrypt with primary, set previous-only-key, decrypt with previous; round-trip works
- [x] Decrypt of garbage → `TokenDecryptError` (not raw `InvalidToken`)
- [x] All existing tests still pass

## Phase 2.6 — Production Assessment Findings (2026-05-29)

Generated by `/assess` (verdict: PRODUCTION-READY = NO). Full per-finding detail
with backed fixes lives in `docs/assessment/modules/*.md` and the ranked register
in `docs/assessment/REPORT.md`. Worked one at a time (CHECK → APPROVE → BUILD →
REVIEW). Re-run `/assess` after each batch to confirm the finding clears.

## Issue 58: psycopg3 prepared statements break under PgBouncer + pool math (SEV-0)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: Code complete (2026-05-29) — staging Locust verification pending

**What**: `db.py:14-20` `create_async_engine` does not disable psycopg3 server-side
prepared statements, but `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md:46` runs PgBouncer in transaction-pooling
mode → `prepared statement "_pg3_…" does not exist` in production (CI passes because it
hits Postgres directly). Also: per-pod pool ceiling `pool_size=10 + max_overflow=20 = 30`
exceeds the 25-conn PgBouncer sidecar; no `pool_recycle`. (scale-checklist axis A)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `connect_args={"prepare_threshold": None}` passed to the engine (`db.py`, asserted by `tests/test_db_engine_config.py`)
- [x] `pool_size`+`max_overflow` (15+5=20) ≤ PgBouncer sidecar (25); total-connections inequality recorded in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- [x] `pool_recycle=1800` set
- [ ] Verified behind PgBouncer via a Locust run (`tests/perf/`) — **deferred to staging** (no PgBouncer in CI/dev container; the misconfiguration is certain by inspection + library docs, but the green-under-load proof needs the real pooler)

## Issue 59: Render from setup_start_s, not the start_s fallback (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29)

**What**: `worker/tasks.py:291` cut the clip from `clip.start_s` (the fixed peak−75s
fallback, `candidates.py:97`), not `clip.setup_start_s` (the computed setup boundary).
Scoring, API, and the eval all key on `setup_start_s` but the rendered bytes didn't —
defeated CLIPPING_PRINCIPLE #2, the core differentiator.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Render cuts from `setup_start_s` via `_render_start_for(clip)` (coalesces to `start_s` only when the nullable `setup_start_s` is unset)
- [x] Frame-accurate ffmpeg seek — `-accurate_seek` set explicitly (already the encoding default; pinned so a future `-c copy` can't reintroduce GOP drift). The assessment's "drift" SEV-2 was a false positive for this re-encoding pipeline (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`)
- [x] DB-free unit guards (`tests/test_render.py::test_render_start_*`, `::test_render_clip_file_uses_accurate_seek_before_input`) + end-to-end integration test (`tests/test_render_setup_start_integration.py`) asserting the persisted `setup_start_s` reaches `render_clip_file`

## Issue 60: Wire the personalization loop (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29)

**What**: Personalization was unshipped. `preference/train.py:28 build_and_save` had no
caller (model never trained → `load_latest` always None), and
`clip_engine/ranking.py:26 rerank_with_preference` was never invoked (model never applied).
Ranking was DNA-only; the North-Star "learns your style" loop did not run. Also: fixed
50/50 blend with no maturity gating (no honest below-threshold fallback per CLAUDE.md).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Idempotent, self-debouncing `retrain_preference(creator_id)` Celery task (`worker/tasks.py`), enqueued from the feedback endpoint (`routers/review.py`) after each write; no-op when no new trainable feedback since the latest model version
- [x] `rerank_with_preference` called at the end of `generate_and_rank_clips`, gated on a trained model
- [x] `preference_weight(label_count)` ramps the blend: 0 below `PERSONALIZATION_THRESHOLD_LABELS`, linear to `PREFERENCE_WEIGHT_CAP` (new config) by 2× threshold; blend `(1-w)*dna + w*pref` recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] DB-free unit tests (weight curve + rerank gating below/above threshold + no-model) + integration test (`tests/test_retrain_preference_integration.py`): trains v1 then self-debounces
- Deferred (explicit): `build_and_save` version-race hardening → **Issue 71**; `from_bytes` off-loop/caching → **Issues 68/71** (retrain task catches `IntegrityError` as a minimal guard meanwhile)

## Issue 61: generate_clips idempotency — stop wiping feedback/outcomes (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 1)

**What**: `build_signals` re-enqueued `generate_clips` on every run; `generate_and_rank_clips`
did `delete(Clip).where(video_id==…)` and `Clip.feedback`/`outcome` are
`cascade=all,delete-orphan` (models.py:364/367). A redelivery (acks_late) silently destroyed
creator feedback labels + published-clip outcomes → corrupted the preference training signal.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `generate_and_rank_clips` is idempotent — early-returns existing clips (in rank order) instead of delete+reinsert when clips already exist for the video; never cascade-wipes feedback
- [x] Integration test (`tests/test_generate_clips_idempotency_integration.py`): re-run generation → existing clip + its feedback survive

## Issue 62: Celery delivery safety — reject_on_worker_lost + time/visibility limits (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: 61
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 1)

**What**: `worker/celery_app.py` set `acks_late=True` without
`task_reject_on_worker_lost` → an OOM-killed media task was silently dropped (video stuck
forever). No `task_time_limit`/`task_soft_time_limit` and no broker `visibility_timeout`
override → a long task redelivered while still running → double execution. (axis C)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `task_reject_on_worker_lost=True` (safe with Issue 61)
- [x] `task_soft_time_limit=3000` < `task_time_limit=3300` < `broker_transport_options.visibility_timeout=3600` — invariant guarded by `tests/test_celery_config.py`
- [x] `render_clip` idempotent — `_render_clip_async` early-returns when `render_status==done` and `render_uri` set; integration test asserts no re-encode/storage I/O

## Issue 63: Idempotent build_dna on redelivery (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 2)

**What**: `create_draft` derived version via `max(version)+1`; a post-commit redelivery
inserted a second draft (duplicate DNA + double Anthropic/Voyage spend). `confirm_draft`
also lacked locking (two confirms → two `confirmed`).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `build_dna` idempotent on a stable key — the Celery `task_id` (`self.request.id`) is stamped as `creator_dna.build_job_id`; `_build_dna_async` early-returns before the paid LLM/Voyage calls when a draft for that job already exists (migration `0005`)
- [x] Partial unique index `uq_one_confirmed_dna_per_creator ON creator_dna(creator_id) WHERE status='confirmed'` + `with_for_update()` in `confirm_draft` (ordered flush: supersede before promote, since the index is non-deferrable; `IntegrityError` backstop)
- [x] Integration tests (`tests/test_dna_idempotency_integration.py`): same job_id twice → one draft + one brief call; confirm twice / new draft → exactly one confirmed

## Issue 64: Self-idempotent grant_minutes (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 2)

**What**: `grant_minutes` was not self-idempotent; money-credit idempotency rode on a caller
TOCTOU check backstopped only by `UNIQUE(stripe_session_id)`, and the race loser raised an
uncaught 500. Hardened at the source, mirroring `deduct_for_video`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Fast-path existence check (keyed grants) + `begin_nested()` SAVEPOINT + `flush()` + `IntegrityError` catch → idempotent no-op on duplicate delivery
- [x] Concurrent-grant integration test (`tests/test_billing_grant_idempotency_integration.py`): two sessions, same `stripe_session_id` via `asyncio.gather` → one MinutePack, balance credited once

## Issue 65: pgvector HNSW index + missing FK indexes (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 3)

**What**: `dna_embeddings.embedding Vector(1024)` had no HNSW/IVFFlat index → O(rows) `<=>`
cosine scans that degrade as the corpus grows. `clip_feedback.creator_id` was an unindexed
FK hit by the preference training query + retrain debounce. (axis H)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Alembic migration `0006`: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ix_dna_embeddings_hnsw ... USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (m=16, ef_construction=200)` in an `autocommit_block` (online-safe); op class matches the `<=>` query
- [x] `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ix_clip_feedback_creator_id ON clip_feedback (creator_id)`
- [x] Integration test (`tests/test_vector_index_integration.py`) introspects `pg_indexes` for both
- Scope correction: `dna_embeddings.creator_id` (indexed in 0001) and `preference_models.creator_id` (covered by the `(creator_id, version)` unique index) needed no new index — assessment was imprecise; see `docs/DECISIONS.md`

## Issue 66: Move the 120s improvement brief off the API event loop (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 4a)

**What**: `routers/improvement.py:65` called the synchronous 120s Anthropic+web_search
`generate_improvement_brief` directly inside an `async def` handler → pinned the event
loop, collapsing p99 for every concurrent request on that worker. (axis B)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Brief generation offloaded via `await asyncio.to_thread(generate_improvement_brief, ...)` — frees the loop
- [x] Integration test asserts the call is offloaded (recorded through a to_thread shim)
- Follow-up (Issue 75): the request still runs up to 120s (can exceed an LB/gateway timeout); the full 202/poll Celery UX is tracked there. `to_thread` resolves the axis-B loop-blocking now.

## Issue 67: Move synchronous large-file upload off the API loop (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 4a)

**What**: `routers/videos.py` called synchronous `upload_file` (boto3 R2 PUT / `shutil.copy2`)
inside `async def upload_video` → a multi-hundred-MB write blocked the loop. Same class:
`delete_prefix` in `delete_account`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `await asyncio.to_thread(upload_file, …)` in upload; `await asyncio.to_thread(delete_prefix, prefix)` in delete_account
- [x] Integration test asserts the storage write is offloaded; existing upload/streaming tests still pass

## Issue 68: Sync LLM/Voyage/transcription off the worker loop + timeouts (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 4b)

**What**: Sync calls ran on the worker's singleton event loop and transcription had no
upper bound: `generate_brief` (Anthropic), `_embed` (Voyage, tenacity sleeping on the
loop), `transcribe_audio` (Deepgram/AssemblyAI/WhisperX), `extract_audio_events` (librosa).
(axes B/E)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] All four offloaded via `await asyncio.to_thread(...)` (Voyage in `dna/embeddings.py`; brief/transcribe/audio-events at the `worker/tasks.py` call sites)
- [x] `TRANSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT_S` (config + `.env.example`, default 300) applied as a job-level bound via `asyncio.wait_for(asyncio.to_thread(transcribe_audio, …), timeout=…)`
- [x] Tenacity backoff no longer sleeps on the event loop (the whole `_embed` runs in a thread)
- Follow-up (Issue 75): SDK-native request timeouts (Deepgram/AssemblyAI) — `wait_for` bounds the job but can't kill the worker thread; the SDKs aren't installed here to verify their timeout params. Voyage already self-bounds (timeout=30).

## Issue 69: Fix prompt caching — split static/volatile blocks (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 5)

**What**: both briefs interpolated per-creator data INTO the `cache_control` system block
(prefix changed every call); `improvement/brief.py` returned `text_blocks[0]` — with
web_search that's the "let me search…" preamble, not the answer.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] System split into a static cached prefix + a separate uncached volatile block (both briefs); verified via `/claude-api`
- [x] `improvement` returns the final text block (`[-1]`) after the last tool_use; dna uses `[-1]` for consistency; multi-block fixture test
- [x] DB-free unit tests assert the split shape (no creator data in the cached block) + the final-block extraction; existing `test_generate_brief_uses_prompt_caching` updated to the 2-block contract
- **Finding (`/claude-api`):** Sonnet 4.6's minimum cacheable prefix is 2048 tokens; these static prefixes are ~350-450 tokens, so the cache does NOT engage for these low-frequency calls regardless of structure. The split is correct-structure, not a cost win here. The real caching beneficiary — the clip scorer's large per-creator prefix reused across videos — is tracked under Issue 75. (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`)

## Issue 70: Bound poll_clip_outcomes quota drain (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 6)

**What**: `poll_clip_outcomes` re-polled every `ClipOutcome` 7 days after its last fetch
with no terminal marker → unbounded YouTube-quota drain; also held one session across an
N×M awaited-network loop. (axes E/F)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `clip_outcomes.final` column (migration `0007`) + partial index; the 7d checkpoint poll sets `final=True` and the query excludes `final IS TRUE`
- [x] Candidate set capped to clips created within ~10 days (`Clip.created_at >= now-10d`)
- [x] Commit per creator so a slow YouTube call can't hold one transaction across the batch
- [x] Integration test: a 7d poll marks `final`; a finalized outcome is never polled again

## Issue 71: Preference unpickler thread-safety + version race (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 7)

**What**: `from_bytes` monkeypatched a joblib module global during load → not thread-safe
(the RCE allowlist could be defeated under concurrent loads); `build_and_save` `max()+1`
raced to `IntegrityError`; `predict_score` swallowed all errors into `0.5`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] The global swap is serialized by a module `threading.Lock` (a directly-instantiated unpickler was rejected — joblib's `NumpyUnpickler` signature is version-fragile; documented in DECISIONS)
- [x] Version assignment serialized via `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(creator_id))` (held to commit)
- [x] `predict_score` validates `n_features_in_` and **raises** on drift; `load_latest` returns `None` on feature-schema drift; `rerank_with_preference` scores all clips before mutating and falls back to DNA order if the scorer raises
- [x] DB-free unit tests: predict_score raises on feature mismatch; rerank falls back to DNA when the scorer raises

## Issue 72: OAuth httpx singleton + timeouts (SEV-1)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-29, Batch 4b)

**What**: `youtube/oauth.py` built a fresh `httpx.AsyncClient` per call with no timeout on
the token-refresh hot path; `data_api`/`analytics` constructed the client inside the retry
loop (no connection reuse). (axes B/E)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] New `youtube/_http.py`: lazy per-process singleton `client()` (`Timeout(15, connect=5)`) + `aclose()`; reused by all three OAuth helpers + `_get_json` + `_fetch_report`; closed in the API lifespan and worker shutdown
- [x] 5xx responses get backoff-retry before `raise_for_status` (idempotent GETs)
- [x] Unit tests: singleton identity + recreate-after-close; 503-then-200 backoff via httpx MockTransport. Existing oauth-lifecycle tests rebased onto the `_http.client` boundary
- Note: token-refresh logging already emits only a message + creator id (no exception object) — verified, no change needed

## Issue 73: Pydantic response_model + input validation on routes (SEV-2)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: Partially done (2026-05-29, Batch 8) — security item done; response_model coverage tracked in Issue 75

**What**: `youtube_video_id` was an unvalidated `Form(...)` interpolated into a storage key;
most endpoints return a bare `dict` with no `response_model`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `youtube_video_id` validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{11}$` (422 on bad input) on both `/videos/link` and `/videos/upload`, before the value reaches a storage key — DB-free unit test
- [x] A Pydantic `*Out` model + `response_model=` on every endpoint — DONE (action #3). 18 endpoints across 7 routers now declare a `response_model` (typed OpenAPI + response-side field allow-list). Standing guard `tests/test_response_models.py` fails if a future documented JSON route ships without one.

## Issue 74: Bound transcription/audio memory (SEV-2)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: Done (2026-05-29, Batch 8) — Deepgram-stream item deferred to Issue 75

**What**: `librosa.load(sr=None)` decoded the full waveform at native rate (≈690 MB/hr) → OOM
vector; WhisperX model + SDK clients reconstructed per call.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `librosa.load(sr=16000)` — ~3× less memory; heuristics need no more fidelity (the universal path; verified locally)
- [x] WhisperX model + align model cached via `lru_cache`; Deepgram client + AssemblyAI key as module-level singletons
- [ ] Deepgram full-file `f.read()` → file-stream — **deferred (Issue 75)**: the deepgram SDK isn't installed here to verify the streaming API, and `sr=16000` already removes the dominant memory vector

## Issue 75: SEV-2 / cleanup long tail + dependency CVEs + compliance (tracking)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: Open (tracking) — two concrete items done; research/infra items remain

**Done in Batch 8:**
- [x] (c) Stripe-key **prod fail-fast** — `config.py` `model_validator` requires `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` when `ENV=production` (DB-free unit test)
- [x] (d) `upload_intel/timing.py` `IndexError`→500 — out-of-range `day_of_week`/`hour` rows skipped (DB-free unit test)

**Done 2026-05-29 (CVE remediation session):**
- [x] (a) **14 pip-audit CVEs → 0.** Patched 6 packages (cryptography→46.0.7,
  python-multipart→0.0.27, PyJWT→2.12.0, lightgbm→4.6.0, python-dotenv→1.2.2,
  starlette→0.49.1 via FastAPI→0.120.4); 2 residuals accepted-risk in
  `gate_pip_audit`'s `--ignore-vuln` allowlist (pytest dev-cascade GHSA-6w46-j5rx-g56g;
  starlette Host-header PYSEC-2026-161, fixable only on the starlette-1.x line) with
  DECISIONS justification. `pip_audit_vulns` baseline ratcheted 14→0; full suite green.

**Remaining (each its own focused effort — not single-commit changes):**
- [ ] **starlette-1.x migration** (FastAPI→0.136.x) to close PYSEC-2026-161 and drop it
  from the ignore-list — a major-line bump; do as its own issue with a full test run.
- [ ] (b) YouTube **analytics retention/refresh cadence** vs ToS (`youtube/analytics.py`, COMPLIANCE.md §2) — needs the actual ToS cadence figure, then a scheduled refresh/purge
- [ ] (e) ratchet `mypy_errors` 30→0, then enable `disallow_untyped_defs`
- [x] (f) observability — DONE (2026-05-29). `observability.py`: pure-ASGI
  `RequestIDMiddleware` (mint/echo `X-Request-ID`, ContextVar) + JSON structured logs
  with `request_id` + Prometheus golden signals (`http_request_duration_seconds`,
  `celery_task_*`) at `/metrics`; correlation id propagated API→Celery via
  before_task_publish/task_prerun/task_postrun signals. +9 tests. See DECISIONS
  2026-05-29. Follow-up: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing (deferred).
- [x] **Full `response_model` coverage** across the 18 endpoints (from Issue 73) — DONE (action #3).
  `*Out` models + `response_model=` on every documented JSON endpoint in 7 routers; standing guard
  `tests/test_response_models.py`. Faithful field-for-field modeling verified by the full endpoint suite.
- [x] **Deepgram file-stream** upload (from Issue 74) — DONE (action #2). `transcribe.py`
  streams the open file handle (`FileSource.buffer` accepts a `BufferedReader`) instead of
  `f.read()`, so httpx uploads in chunks and the ~115 MB/hr WAV is never held in a Python
  bytes object. Plus a `TRANSCRIPTION_MAX_MB` fail-fast size guard before any read/upload.
- [x] **SDK-native transcription timeout** (Deepgram/AssemblyAI) — DONE (action #2). New
  `TRANSCRIPTION_HTTP_TIMEOUT_S` (default 120, kept < the 300s job `wait_for`): Deepgram gets
  an `httpx.Timeout` per `transcribe_file`; AssemblyAI sets `aai.settings.http_timeout`. A hung
  provider socket now returns the blocking thread before the job timeout (which can't cancel it).
- [ ] **Clip-scorer prompt caching** — the real caching beneficiary (large per-creator prefix reused across videos), from Issue 69. Re-run also flagged the cheap prefix-ordering win: put the static principles block BEFORE `{dna_brief}` in `clip_engine/scoring.py:182-191` so the long static prefix is shared across creators
- [ ] **Per-(creator, version) scorer cache** so `from_bytes` runs once, not per rerank (from Issue 71) — confirmed still absent: `preference/train.py:116` deserializes on every rerank (`clip_engine/ranking.py:39`)
- [x] **Improvement-brief 202/poll** Celery UX (the 120s request can exceed an LB timeout; from Issue 66) — done in Issue 78d (2026-05-30)
- [ ] ~23 remaining SEV-2 + ~24 cleanup items in `docs/assessment/modules/*.md` — see Issue 76 for the net-new ones from the re-run

## Issue 76: Re-assessment re-run findings (2026-05-29, post-hardening /assess)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: Open (tracking) — net-new findings from the post-Issues-58–75 `/assess` re-run.
Verdict moved NO → **CONDITIONAL** (0 BLOCKER, 4 SEV1, 23 SEV2, 24 cleanup). Full register and
backed fixes in `docs/assessment/REPORT.md` + `docs/assessment/modules/*.md`; snapshot in
`docs/assessment/history/2026-05-29-rerun-post-hardening-REPORT.md`.

**SEV1**
- [x] **`build_dna` concurrent-redelivery double-spend** (`worker/tasks.py:423-430` + `dna/profile.py:52-55`).
  The idempotency re-check ran in its own closed session, not serialized against the draft INSERT;
  `build_job_id` was non-unique. Serial redelivery was safe (Issue 63), but two *concurrent* same-`job_id`
  deliveries both ran the paid Anthropic brief + Voyage embeddings before the version UNIQUE collided,
  and the loser raised → Celery retries. **DONE (action #1):** per-creator `pg_advisory_xact_lock` at
  the top of the build txn with the re-check under it + partial UNIQUE on `build_job_id WHERE NOT NULL`
  (migration 0008) + IntegrityError→no-op. Concurrent-redelivery regression test verified on real PG.

**SEV2 (net-new)**
- [ ] clip_engine `ranking.py:129` — `dna_match` seeded to the composite score, never refined →
  preference model fed a duplicate of its own target as a "DNA-fit" feature (collinear). Persist a
  DNA-only fit distinct from `clip.score`, or rename to `seed_score`.
- [ ] clip_engine `candidates.py:94-113` — candidate windows never deduped; adjacent peaks can yield
  near-identical clips (vs principle #9). Drop candidates overlapping a kept one >50% IoU.
- [x] DONE (Issue C) — clip_engine `routers/clips.py:67` — `extract_candidates`/`compute_features` CPU runs on the
  FastAPI loop. Dispatch to Celery (202) or `asyncio.to_thread`.
- [x] DONE (Issue A) — youtube `oauth.py:303-313` — lock-wait re-read hits the identity map (`expire_on_commit=False`)
  → stale token → spurious 503 under concurrent refresh. `session.refresh`/`populate_existing=True`.
- [x] youtube `quota.py:51` — DONE (beta-blocker). Daily counter now keyed by the
  `America/Los_Angeles` date (Google's reset zone) via `_QUOTA_RESET_TZ`, so it rolls over with
  Google's quota instead of ~8h early on the UTC date. Regression test pins a UTC-vs-PT split day.
- [x] DONE (Issue A) — youtube `ingest.py:44-62` — `extract_audio_wav` `subprocess.run` has no `timeout=`. Add bounded
  timeout (∝ duration, floor ~600s); map `TimeoutExpired`→RuntimeError.
- [x] DONE (Issue A) — youtube `analytics.py:51`/`data_api.py:93` — 429 backoff ignores `Retry-After`. Honor it.
- [ ] worker `tasks.py:547-556` — `poll_clip_outcomes` doesn't `break` on quota exhaustion (vs
  analytics refresh). Catch `QuotaExhaustedError` and break.
- [ ] worker `tasks.py:357-394` — `_render_clip_async` not concurrent-safe: two workers both read
  `pending`, both encode+upload same key. `with_for_update()` + re-check under lock.
- [ ] worker `tasks.py:222-259` — `_ingest_async` re-extracts/re-uploads the derived WAV on redelivery
  (no corruption, wasted ffmpeg+R2). Short-circuit when `source_uri` is already the derived key.
- [x] DONE (Issue B) — dna `builder.py:223-224,137-161` — `_enrich_video` N+1: ~60 serial queries/build. Batch into
  3 `IN (...)` queries.
- [x] DONE (Issue B) — dna `builder.py:107-117` — `rank_videos` unbounded fetch into worker memory. Cap with
  `.limit(DNA_MAX_CANDIDATE_VIDEOS=500)`.
- [x] DONE (Issue B) — dna `builder.py:201-202` — `kind` compared against bare string literals vs `VideoKind` enum
  value → a rename silently empties buckets. Compare against `VideoKind.long.value`.
- [ ] routers list endpoints (`videos.py:40-55`,`clips.py:93-99`,`upload_intel.py:22-25`) — unbounded
  `list(scalars())`. Add keyset/offset pagination with a hard cap (100).
- [ ] routers `videos.py:62,93` — `link_video`/`upload_video` raw `Form(...)` with no request model
  (id regex-validated). Wrap in a body model or record the multipart deviation in DECISIONS.
- [x] _root_infra `main.py:102-107` — DONE (beta-blocker). `/metrics` now gated behind a
  `METRICS_TOKEN` bearer token (constant-time compare); config fails fast in production if metrics
  are enabled without a token, so the scrape surface can't be exposed unauthenticated. Empty token
  = open for dev/internal-network. Tests cover the gate + the prod fail-fast.
- [ ] _root_infra `observability.py:189-211` — correlation-id ContextVars are safe only under the
  prefork pool. Assert/document the prefork assumption, or key task start off `task.request`.
- [x] billing `ledger.py:89-92` — DONE (beta-blocker). The non-keyed (trial/manual) path now
  re-raises IntegrityError instead of swallowing it, so a new beta user can't silently get 0 trial
  minutes; the keyed (Stripe) path still no-ops on the UNIQUE race. Integration test covers it.
- [ ] upload_intel `timing.py:54-55` — `optimal_gap_hours` left out of the 75d bounds/coercion guard;
  the two functions disagree on a valid row. Filter+coerce first (mirror `best_upload_windows`).
- [ ] ingestion `transcribe.py:71-85,99-110` — hosted-provider normalizers use hard-key indexing →
  opaque `KeyError` on a missing timestamp. Switch to `.get(..., default)` (WhisperX already does).

**cleanup (24)**: typing gaps the mypy ratchet will catch, DRY extractions, magic-constant naming,
the clip-scorer cache-prefix ordering. Per-finding detail in `docs/assessment/modules/*.md`.

## Issue 77: Beta UX polish + brand rename to AutoClip
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: Done (2026-05-30) — caught during a real device walkthrough of the beta UI.

- [x] **Brand → AutoClip.** Renamed the user-facing brand from "CreatorClip" to "AutoClip"
  across `static/*` + `auth.js`, the user-facing brief disclaimers (`dna/brief.py`,
  `improvement/brief.py`), the CLAUDE.md honesty constraint sentence, and the two
  brand-asserting tests. ("Creator DNA" the *feature* is unchanged.) **Internal identifiers
  intentionally left as `creatorclip`** (package, docker image, DB role, Redis key prefix,
  docs) — a deeper rename is a separate, larger task if wanted.
- [x] **Dashboard "undefined / vundefined".** `index.html` read `dna.status`/`dna.version`
  but `/creators/me/dna` nests them under `.profile`. Now reads `dna.profile?.status/version`
  and shows "Not built" when null.
- [x] **Channel-data raw JSON.** `onboarding.html` step 2 used htmx to swap the data-gate
  JSON straight into the page. Replaced with a JS render (✓/• per type + friendly summary),
  loaded on page open and on refresh.
- [x] **"Queued (task <uuid>)" + "what does queued mean".** Build-DNA no longer leaks the
  Celery task id; copy explains what's happening and then **polls `/creators/me/dna`** and
  flips to "Your Creator Brief is ready — review & confirm" when the draft lands.
- [x] **API path leaked as UI copy.** Backend `get_dna` "No DNA profile yet. POST
  /creators/me/dna/build…" → friendly "No Creator DNA yet — build it from the setup screen…".

## Issue 78: Salvage net-new work from closed PR #6 (`claude/busy-mendel-1r2oZ`)
**Depends on**: —
**Status**: Open — re-implement cleanly on top of current `main` (do NOT merge the old branch).

PR #6 was a parallel earlier-session workstream that branched off pre-PR#5 `main` and
re-did much of Issue 75 (CVEs, observability, response_model — all now already on `main`
via #4/#5). It conflicted across 18 files and was **closed without merging** to avoid
regressing `main`. These items it contained are **genuinely not yet on `main`** — rebuild
each fresh, test-gated, against current `main` (the old commits remain in git history on
the retired branch for reference):

- [x] **Per-(creator, version) preference-scorer cache** (Issue 78a, 2026-05-30) — so
  `from_bytes` runs once, not per rerank (also tracked under Issue 76). Per-worker bounded
  LRU keyed by `(creator_id, version)` in `preference/_scorer_cache.py`; `load_latest` now
  does a cheap version+schema query, returns the cached scorer on hit, fetches+deserializes
  the blob only on miss. Monotonic versions ⇒ free invalidation. +5 DB-free tests.
- [x] **Clip-scorer prompt caching (1h TTL)** (Issue 78b, 2026-05-30) — the real caching
  beneficiary (large per-creator prefix reused across videos); also Issue 76. Split the
  system into a static instructions+principles block (stable, first) and a per-creator
  `CREATOR DNA:` block carrying a `{"type":"ephemeral","ttl":"1h"}` breakpoint; candidates
  stay in the uncached user message. Extended TTL (now GA, no beta header) widens the reuse
  window from 5 min → 1h so a creator's batch of videos still hits. Prefix-ordering fix
  (static-first) done; verified via `/claude-api`: at Sonnet-4.6's 2048-token floor only the
  `[static+DNA]` per-creator prefix caches (static alone ~400 tok is sub-floor — the
  cross-creator share is future-proofing, not a present win).
- [x] **mypy 30 → 0** then enable `disallow_untyped_defs` (Issue 75e ratchet) — done (Issue
  78c, 2026-05-30). Enabled the `pydantic.mypy` plugin (−9 config false positives); real fixes
  in `preference/train.py` (loop-var shadow + explicit ndarray types), `youtube/oauth.py`
  (`if creator is None` narrowing), `worker/tasks.py` (None-guard before `delete_file`),
  `preference/model.py` (dropped 2 stale ignores); targeted `# type: ignore[...]` for
  third-party stub lag (anthropic 0.40 `cache_control`/server-tool params, redis async `eval`,
  cv2 `.data`, slowapi handler). Flipped on `disallow_untyped_defs` +
  `disallow_incomplete_defs`; baseline ratcheted 30→0. 431 passed; ruff 0.
- [x] **Improvement-brief → 202 + poll** (Issue 78d, 2026-05-30) — async Celery job (the
  120s request can exceed an LB timeout; also Issue 76). New `ImprovementBrief` model +
  `improvement_brief_status` enum (one row per creator) + migration 0009. `POST
  /creators/me/improvement-brief` now returns 202, debounces an in-flight build, and enqueues
  `generate_improvement_brief`; the worker builds the creator-scoped analytics + DNA brief and
  runs the LLM call (idempotent + safe-fail); `GET` polls the stored row; `insights.html`
  POST→poll. Mirrors the DNA-build precedent. +8 integration tests (3 GET-based isolation
  tests rebased onto the task path).
- [ ] **YouTube analytics retention purge** (Issue 75b) — needs the confirmed ToS staleness
  figure, then a scheduled purge of stale VideoMetrics/RetentionCurve/etc.
- [ ] **PgBouncer load-test harness** — to actually verify the axis-A pool BLOCKER fix
  (Issue 58) under load.
- [x] **Legal routes / Limited Use / CORS lockdown** (Issue 78g, 2026-05-30) — reconciled
  with what already shipped. Verified already-done: CORS locked to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (never
  `*`, `main.py`); `/docs`+`/redoc` gated on `ENV=="development"`; `static/tos.html` +
  `static/privacy.html` served + tested. The genuine delta was the **Google Limited Use
  disclosure** — required by `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` in the public Privacy Policy before launch
  but absent; added the canonical attestation + the four Limited-Use commitments to
  `static/privacy.html`, with a test pinning the required language.

### Issue 83: Creator Intake Form — stated identity layer fused with inferred DNA
**Severity**: FEATURE — addresses "DNA takes a long time" cold-start + adds a structural honesty signal
**Depends on**: 79 ✅ (RLS — so per-creator queries on `creator_identity` are policy-gated once RLS is activated)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-30)

**What**: A self-described identity layer fused with the inferred `creator_dna`. Captures
who the creator says they are (niche, audience, mission), how they describe their voice
(tone tags), what they refuse to do (hard-nos), and an optional writing/style sample.
Used as a stable per-creator system block in every Claude call so the LLM treats the
creator's own words as authoritative for "what they're trying to build," and only uses
inferred patterns to fill in "what's actually working."

**Why**: Two problems in one. (1) The inferred DNA pipeline takes 30+s end-to-end (LLM call
+ analytics fetch + embeddings) and can't ship a useful first-pass result until everything
finishes. (2) The inferred pipeline can only see what has accidentally performed well —
it cannot see what the creator is trying to build. The stated identity ships an instant
cold-start signal and adds the dimension inference structurally lacks.

**Approach** (per the 2026 industry-standard research summarized in DECISIONS):
- Form-driven, NOT sample-text-driven (samples are already covered by the inferred path).
- 5-field intake: 1 required niche multi-select (1–3 of the YouTube Data API categories) +
  1 required audience description + 3 optional fields (mission, content pillars, tone tags,
  hard-nos, style sample).
- **Strictly separate from `creator_dna`** — two tables, fused at query time, never merged.
  Silently overriding stated intent with engagement is the YouTube-algorithm problem
  recreated inside our own tool; we surface conflicts to the creator instead.
- Append-only versioned (`creator_identity.superseded_at IS NULL` ⇔ current; partial
  unique index is the DB-level backstop).
- Multi-step UX with skip-from-step-1 affordance (research: 52.9% higher completion vs
  single-page; forced pre-value intake is the 70%-drop-off norm).

**Files (delivered)**:
- `alembic/versions/0012_creator_identity.py` — append-only table + partial unique + history index
- `models.py::CreatorIdentity`
- `youtube/categories.py` — static 15-option NICHE_OPTIONS list (YouTube Data API IDs)
- `dna/identity.py` — `get_current` / `get_history` / `upsert_identity` with FOR UPDATE +
  IntegrityError race recovery, plus `format_for_prompt` (cache-friendly: returns None
  rather than emitting "(no identity)") and `validate_*` helpers shared with the router
- `dna/conflict.py` — niche-keyword-vs-inferred-patterns mismatch detector, returns a
  one-line nudge for the UI
- `dna/brief.py` — `generate_brief()` accepts `stated_identity`; injects it as the 2nd
  system block; moves the `cache_control` breakpoint to the last stable block
- `worker/tasks.py::_build_dna_async` — fetches identity via `AdminSessionLocal` and
  passes it into `generate_brief`
- `routers/creators.py` — `GET /creators/niches` (public; intake form depends on it),
  `GET /creators/me/identity` (current + conflict nudge), `POST /creators/me/identity`
  (creates new version), `GET /creators/me/identity/history` (max 20 versions)
- `static/onboarding.html` — optional inline intake card (step 3 of 5)
- `static/profile.html` — full identity edit form, current-version summary, conflict nudge
- `tests/test_identity_unit.py` — 21 unit tests
- `tests/test_identity_integration.py` — 4 integration tests against real Postgres

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `creator_identity` table created via alembic 0012; cascade-deletes with creator
- [x] Partial unique index `uq_one_current_identity_per_creator` enforces ≤1 current row
- [x] `POST /creators/me/identity` creates a new version, stamps `superseded_at` on prior
- [x] `GET /creators/me/identity` returns current row (or null) + conflict nudge (or null)
- [x] `GET /creators/me/identity/history` returns newest-first, max 20
- [x] `GET /creators/niches` returns the stable category list (works pre-session)
- [x] Validation: 1–3 niches (must be from the known list), audience required, dedup'd lists
- [x] Identity injected into `dna/brief.py` as the 2nd system block with cache_control on it
- [x] Identity is omitted entirely (not "(no identity)") when missing — cache-friendly
- [x] Conflict detector returns a niche-mismatch nudge when stated niche keywords miss patterns
- [x] Per-creator isolation: A's GET never returns B's row (integration test)
- [x] Onboarding step 3 + profile.html edit form both wired; skip path preserved
- [x] No virality language anywhere new; preserves the AutoClip honesty constraint
- [x] All gates green: ruff format/check, mypy 0, pytest passes

### Issue 84: AI/LLM efficiency assessment — context engineering, caching, latency vs quality
**Severity**: ASSESSMENT — informs every downstream LLM change
**Depends on**: 83 ✅ (so identity injection is in scope of the audit)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — Wave 2)

**What**: User asked for a focused assessment of how we use Anthropic right now:
context engineering at every call site, the actual realized prompt-cache hit rate (the
2026 5-minute TTL change in particular), and the speed-vs-quality tradeoffs at each
step. Goal: the service should feel **fast** without being **shallow**.

**Scope (do a real Phase 1 CHECK before scoping further — Anthropic SDK + caching
state move fast):**
- Audit every Anthropic call site: `dna/brief.py`, `improvement/brief.py`,
  `clip_engine/scoring.py`. Confirm block ordering, cache breakpoints, system-vs-user
  placement, max_tokens, model choice (Sonnet vs Opus for which call).
- Measure the realized cache hit rate from `cache_read_input_tokens` /
  `cache_creation_input_tokens` logs over a representative session.
- Identify pipeline opportunities to co-locate calls under one cache prefix (clip
  scoring + ranking + explanation in one pass?) to actually reap caching savings
  given the 5-minute TTL.
- Identify any call that could be batched (Anthropic batch API), streamed, or
  replaced with a smaller model.
- Evaluate latency: time-to-first-byte and total wall-clock for the DNA build (the
  motivating "DNA takes a LONG time" complaint).
- Recommend a **target SLO** per call site (e.g. "DNA brief P50 < 8s, P95 < 20s").

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research the current Anthropic SDK + caching best practices for 2026 (industry-standards-researcher walk; full record in `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-31 Issue 84 entry)
- [x] Per-call-site report in `docs/assessment/llm/<call-site>.md` — `dna_brief.md`, `clip_scoring.md`, `improvement_brief.md` (placement, cache hit reality, recommended SLO, follow-ups)
- [x] One pipeline candidate identified — co-locate clip scoring + per-clip explanation under one Claude call with the DNA brief as cached prefix. Flagged for Issue 94's Phase-1.
- [x] At least one concrete latency win shipped — `ANTHROPIC_WEB_SEARCH_TOOL` bumped from `web_search_20250305` → `web_search_20260209` (dynamic filtering). 1-LOC config + 2 regression tests.
- [x] DECISIONS entry captured 2026-05-31. Includes follow-up issues to be filed (SDK bump; drop unproductive cache markers on DNA + improvement brief; Haiku 4.5 A/B for clip scoring).

### Issue 85: UI redesign — sleek editing-tool aesthetic (away from "AI-generated website" vibe)
**Severity**: FEATURE — pre-public-launch polish
**Depends on**: 84 ✅ (so any UI surfacing of LLM output is informed by the assessment) — soft dep
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-18) — executed as the React + TS overhaul (strangler-fig). Foundation-first
sequencing + genuine redesign approved 2026-06-18. **85a–85g: DONE (85g = soft cutover).** Full
static-file retirement is a tracked staging-verified follow-up.

**Migration breakdown (filed 2026-06-18; each shippable + verifiable on its own):**
- **85a — Foundation ✅ DONE 2026-06-18**: React Router v7 **Data Mode** (`createBrowserRouter`)
  + shared `AppLayout` (persistent Nav/Footer + auth gate via `<Outlet/>`); **TanStack Query v5**
  data layer (`useAuth` → cached `useQuery`); `useTaskStream` SSE hook (lifecycle + cleanup);
  **React Testing Library** added to Vitest (6 new tests); **design system** documented in
  `docs/UI.md` + applied to the SPA `@theme` (warmer OKLCH dark-Linear palette, confidence-tier
  + motion + shadow + 8pt tokens); Profile + Chat **re-homed** onto the shared shell. Verified:
  eslint 0, `tsc -b`+build clean, vitest 12/12. (Visual QA of palette pending running stack.)
- **85b — Pre-auth + presentational ✅ DONE 2026-06-18**: ported **login** (faithful; OAuth button
  stays a real nav, `?yt=` carried), **pricing** (public-or-authed — renders the grid for anon;
  Stripe checkout + `crypto.randomUUID` intent preserved, URLs → `/app/pricing`), **walkthrough**
  (5-panel first-run, keyboard nav). Split `AppLayout` → `AuthGate` + `AppChrome` (four route
  contexts); `useAuth` now 401→null (redirect moved to `AuthGate`); `api()`/Nav/Chat login+pricing
  targets → `/app/*`. **`early-access` descoped** — dead `/billing/early-access` endpoint +
  subscription tiers that contradict the minutes model (OFF_COURSE_BUGS; product decision in 85g).
  Verified: eslint 0, build clean, vitest 17/17 (+5).
- **85c — Dashboard ✅ DONE 2026-06-18** (`static/index.html` → `pages/Dashboard.tsx` at
  `/app/dashboard`): summary cards, YouTube-analytics panel, link-a-video form, video table with
  per-row Queue/Generate/review/Titles actions + the Issue-139 upload affordance, empty-state hero,
  trial + low-balance + DNA-CTA banners. **Live status via gated TanStack `refetchInterval`**
  (replaces the hand-rolled poll loop; pauses when the tab is unfocused). Per-video clip counts via
  `useQueries`. **Activity panel: inline now, global floating widget deferred** (user-approved).
  SPA catch-all + Nav "Dashboard" now point at the SPA route. Verified: eslint 0, build clean,
  vitest 22/22 (+5). DECISIONS 2026-06-18.
- **85d — Onboarding ✅ DONE 2026-06-18** (`static/onboarding.html` → `pages/Onboarding.tsx` at
  `/app/onboarding`, protected+bare): 5-step flow — connect YouTube, channel data gate (catalog sync
  with a **live SSE console** + gated data-gate poll), optional slim identity intake (niche + audience,
  unlocks the next step), DNA build (**live SSE console** + brief-ready poll), confirm (→ profile).
  Reuses `useTaskStream` for both consoles. Preserved the Issue-100 identity gate on DNA build.
  Dashboard `DnaCta` rewired to SPA routes (`sync_catalog`/`build_dna` → onboarding, `confirm_dna` →
  profile). Verified: eslint 0, build clean, vitest 25/25 (+3). DECISIONS 2026-06-18.
- **85e — Insights + Analysis ✅ DONE 2026-06-18** (`static/insights.html` → `pages/Insights.tsx` at
  `/app/insights`; `static/analysis.html` → `pages/Analysis.tsx` at `/app/analysis`). Insights:
  channel snapshot, DNA snapshot, sortable top/bottom performers with per-row AI analyze + save,
  upload windows, improvement brief (SSE log + gated poll), saved insights. Analysis: free-form
  video-analysis (token-streamed prose) + four `?video_id=`-gated features — Title Optimizer, Hook
  Analyzer, Chapter Markers, Thumbnail Concepts. New **`useTaskResult`** hook (token/step/done-payload
  SSE) + `onToken`/`onStep` on the stream layer + `useStreamAction` helper. Nav + dashboard links

- **85g — Cutover ✅ DONE 2026-06-18 (soft)**: `main.py` `/` now **redirects to `/app/dashboard`**
  when the SPA bundle is built (`_SPA_BUILT` gate; legacy index still boots without a build) — the
  React app is the primary surface. Deleted orphaned `early-access.html`. Root tests made flip-aware
  (`skipif(_SPA_BUILT)`, mirroring `test_spa_serving`); legacy-content `/` assertions repointed to
  `/static/index.html` (behavior-preserving, robust whether or not the integration job builds the
  bundle). **Deferred follow-up (staging-verified):** delete/redirect the remaining `static/*.html`
  (keep tos/privacy), repoint backend `next_action` URLs (`routers/insights.py`, `routers/videos.py`)
  to `/app/*`, the global activity-panel widget, and a React marketing hero if/when public. DECISIONS
  2026-06-18.

**What**: User flagged that current static pages (`static/index.html`,
`static/onboarding.html`, `static/profile.html`, `static/review.html`,
`static/insights.html`, `static/pricing.html`) feel like "an AI-generated website,"
not "an actual editing tool." Beta-quality is fine for current users; brand pass is
wanted before public launch. The Issue 83 identity edit form is the most recent
contributor to that vibe and should be reworked in this issue.

**Scope (Phase 1 CHECK should look at):**
- 2026 editing-tool UI references (CapCut, Descript, Riverside, Final Cut for web,
  Frame.io, Lumen5). Common shapes: timeline-first, player-first, dark base with
  saturated accent, dense info-rich panels, keyboard-driven.
- Design system foundations: typography (system stack → swap to Inter/Geist?), 8-pt
  spacing scale, color palette beyond `#6c63ff`, motion language.
- The review surface (`static/review.html`) — should it feel like a TikTok-style
  vertical scroller or a timeline-first editor? Player-first is the established design
  intent (see `docs/PRD.md` "feels like scrolling" bar).
- Whether to introduce a CSS framework (Tailwind / Open Props) or keep hand-rolled.
  The current "vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step" stance is a flagged DECISIONS
  candidate per `docs/SOT.md` ("review-UI framework").
- Component-library candidates if a framework is adopted.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: industry references collected; framework-vs-vanilla DECISIONS entry (2026-06-17 stack + 2026-06-18 foundation/design-system)
- [x] Design system documented (typography, spacing, color, motion) in `docs/UI.md` (2026-06-18, Issue 85a)
- [x] Review surface redesigned to the chosen player-first / timeline-first shape (85f — player-first 2-col, collapsible tools)
- [x] Profile + onboarding + insights surfaces reworked to the design system (Profile re-homed 85a; onboarding 85d; insights + analysis 85e)
- [x] Identity intake form (Issue 83) reworked in the new aesthetic — full editor on Profile (85a `IdentitySection`) + slim intake in onboarding (85d `OnboardingIdentity`)
- [x] No regression in the structural honesty test — `DisclaimerBand` / honesty copy on every ported
      page (asserted in each page's vitest); legacy static honesty tests untouched
- [x] Mobile-responsive baseline — responsive Tailwind throughout (auto-fit/auto-fill grids, `lg:`
      breakpoints that stack on narrow viewports; review is 2-col→1-col)
- [x] All a11y basics — `focus-visible` rings on the Button/input primitives, `aria-label`/`aria-pressed`/
      `aria-expanded` on controls, OKLCH palette tuned for AA body contrast (`docs/UI.md`)

### Issue 86: Live progress surface for long-running LLM + worker tasks
**Severity**: FEATURE — pre-public-launch polish; directly addresses today's prod incident (3+ min frozen spinner on DNA build) and provides a reusable observability primitive for every long task
**Depends on**: nothing — pure additive surface; lands cleanly before Issue 84/85
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-30)

**What**: A reusable per-task progress facility on three layers — (1) **Redis Streams**
(`XADD`/`XREAD` on key `task:{task_id}:events`) as the worker→web bridge with bounded
retention (MAXLEN ~ 200) and TTL expiry, (2) a new authenticated FastAPI endpoint
`GET /tasks/{task_id}/events` returning `text/event-stream` (SSE) that tails the stream
with `BLOCK 5000` reads, sets the three Cloudflare-safe headers (`Cache-Control: no-cache`,
`Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Connection: keep-alive`, plus nginx's
`X-Accel-Buffering: no`), emits a `: keepalive` comment every ~12s, honors `Last-Event-ID`
for reconnect, and enforces a per-creator concurrent-connection cap via Redis `INCR`/`DECR`,
(3) a tiny `worker/progress.py` helper — `sync_emit` / `aemit` `(task_id, event_type,
**fields)` — that every Celery task calls at meaningful stage boundaries, plus a context
manager `stream_and_emit(client, task_id, ...)` in `worker/anthropic_stream.py` that
wraps `Anthropic().messages.stream()` to forward `message_start.usage` (cache hit/miss +
input tokens) → `thinking_delta` chunks → `text_delta` chunks → final usage, returning
`(final_text, usage_dict)`.

DNA build is the first wired call site; the same `emit()` calls drop into
`_ingest_async`, `_transcribe_async`, `_signals_async`, `_render_clip_async`, and
`_generate_improvement_brief_async` in follow-up PRs without touching the SSE / Redis
layer.

**Why**: Today's prod incident — the user clicked "Build Creator DNA," the worker
crash-looped on a `ModuleNotFoundError`, and the UI showed nothing for 3+ minutes
before timing out. The frozen-spinner experience is the same even on the happy path:
the LLM call takes ~30s with zero user-facing feedback. Live progress is the single
biggest "feels like a real tool, not a generic AI website" signal we can ship and
directly motivates Issue 85; the cache-hit observability the streaming wrapper
yields also feeds Issue 84.

**Approach** (per the 2026 industry-standard research summarized in DECISIONS):

| Sub-decision | Choice | Why won |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | SSE (text/event-stream) | One-way append-only; every LLM provider uses SSE; passes Cloudflare Tunnel + corp proxies without protocol upgrade. WebSocket overkill, long-poll laggy, HTTP/2 push deprecated. |
| Worker→web bridge | Redis Streams (XADD/XREAD) | Pub/Sub loses events on page refresh — Streams persist + replay from `0-0` or `Last-Event-ID`. Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY has an 8 KB payload limit + no late-joiner replay. Already-existing Redis singleton, zero new infrastructure. |
| Wire format | Plain JSON-per-event + named `event:` types | EventSource `addEventListener` filters by event type natively. Vercel Data Stream Protocol locks frontend into Vercel React SDK. |
| Cache stat reporting | Read from `message_start.usage` | Anthropic puts `cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` here, available BEFORE the first token — confirmable in the stream. |
| Late-joiner support | XREAD from `Last-Event-ID` cursor (or `0-0`) | EventSource auto-reconnects with this header — the replay is free. |
| Per-creator SSE cap | Redis `INCR sse:count:{creator_id}` + EXPIRE | Per-creator hold-open exhaustion guard; idle timeout caps stale subscribers from a forgotten tab. Set to 3 (two tabs + slow reconnect). |
| Ownership | `task:{task_id}:owner = creator_id` set by API on enqueue | SSE endpoint refuses without ownership match — task ids leak nothing on their own. |

**Files (planned)**:
- `worker/progress.py` — NEW; `sync_emit`, `aemit`, ownership helpers, slot helpers, `aread_since`
- `worker/anthropic_stream.py` — NEW; `stream_and_emit(client, task_id, ...)` returning `(text, usage)`
- `dna/brief.py` — extract `_build_request` helper; add `generate_brief_streaming` alongside `generate_brief` (legacy callers untouched)
- `worker/tasks.py::_build_dna_async` — `aemit` step events at each stage; switch to `generate_brief_streaming`; terminal `done`/`error` emit
- `routers/tasks.py` — NEW; `GET /tasks/{task_id}/events` SSE endpoint with auth, ownership, keepalive, resume, concurrent cap, lifetime cap
- `routers/creators.py::build_dna` — set ownership in Redis post-`.delay()`, return `stream_url` in response
- `main.py` — mount `routers/tasks.py`
- `static/progressStream.js` — NEW; ~40-line EventSource reducer
- `static/onboarding.html` — replace `pollForBrief` with `subscribeToTaskStream`; add terminal-style `<pre>` block
- `tests/test_progress.py` — NEW; sync_emit/aemit/ownership/slot/replay unit tests against real Redis
- `tests/test_anthropic_stream.py` — NEW; stream wrapper with mocked Anthropic client
- `tests/test_tasks_sse.py` — NEW; SSE endpoint integration (auth, ownership, replay, cap, terminal close)
- `tests/test_worker_imports_integration.py` — NEW; subprocess celery worker that imports first-party packages — catches today's PYTHONPATH bug class forever
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — new entry capturing all 7 sub-decisions
- `docs/SOT.md` — file structure additions

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `worker/progress.py` writes XADD with MAXLEN ~ 200, EXPIRE 3600 on terminal events; both sync and async variants
- [x] `worker/anthropic_stream.py::stream_and_emit` forwards `message_start.usage`/`text_delta`/`thinking_delta` and returns `(final_text, usage_dict)`
- [x] `_build_dna_async` emits `step` events at: `acquire_lock`, `analyze_patterns`, `call_claude`, `embed`, and terminal `done`/`error`
- [x] `GET /tasks/{task_id}/events`: auth required (session cookie), ownership-checked, three Cloudflare-safe headers + `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, ~12s keepalive comment, `Last-Event-ID` resume, per-creator concurrent cap = 3, hard lifetime cap = 600s
- [x] Frontend renders progress live in a terminal-style block during the DNA build
- [x] No virality language emitted; no PII/token in any progress payload (compliance tests green)
- [x] `tests/test_worker_imports_integration.py` boots a real celery worker subprocess and confirms `from dna.brief import generate_brief` succeeds — guards the PYTHONPATH fix
- [x] All gates green: ruff format/check, mypy 0, pytest default (492 passed / 1 skipped / 85 deselected)
- [x] DECISIONS entry capturing the 7 sub-decisions
- [x] SOT updated; PROJECT_STATE updated; this issue closed

## Issue 87: Wire up channel catalog sync + fix kind classification (SEV-0 onboarding bug)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-30)

**The bug**: A freshly-connected creator (verified live on `reesepludwick@gmail.com`,
channel "backboard media": 20 Shorts + 3 long-form videos) saw the onboarding data-gate
report `0 long-form videos / 0 Shorts` and never moved past it. `sync_video_catalog` in
`youtube/analytics.py` was defined but had **zero callers** in the entire repo — neither
the OAuth callback nor the Beat refresh task ever populated the `videos` table from the
uploads playlist. Two related defects compounded it: `/videos/link` and `/videos/upload`
both hardcoded `kind=VideoKind.long` (so a manually-pasted Short couldn't be classified
correctly either), and `classify_video_kind` still used the pre-2024 `<=60s` Shorts
threshold (YouTube raised the official max to 180s in October 2024).

**Files**:
- `config.py` + `.env.example` — new `SHORTS_MAX_DURATION_S=180`
- `youtube/data_api.py::classify_video_kind` — reads from settings (180s default)
- `worker/tasks.py` — new `sync_channel_catalog` Celery task + `_sync_channel_catalog_async`
- `worker/tasks.py::_refresh_youtube_analytics_async` — prepends `sync_video_catalog` per creator
- `routers/auth.py::callback` — enqueues `sync_channel_catalog.delay(...)` for new creators
- `routers/creators.py` — new `POST /creators/me/catalog/sync` (5/min, 202+task_id)
- `routers/videos.py::link_video` — resolves `kind`/`duration_s` via `get_videos_metadata`
- `routers/videos.py::upload_video` — resolves `kind` from `probe_duration_s` before R2 PUT
- `static/onboarding.html::refreshDataGate` — POSTs to `/catalog/sync` then polls data-gate
- `tests/test_catalog_sync.py` — 8 unit tests
- `tests/test_analytics.py` — classify boundary tests updated to 180s
- `tests/test_retention_tasks.py` / `tests/test_oauth_lifecycle.py` — mock `sync_video_catalog`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/SOT.md`, `docs/OFF_COURSE_BUGS.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `classify_video_kind(180)` → Short, `(181)` → long (load-bearing boundary tested)
- [x] `sync_channel_catalog` Celery task exists, idempotent (skips known video IDs), commits
- [x] `_refresh_youtube_analytics_async` calls `sync_video_catalog` before per-video analytics
- [x] OAuth callback enqueues catalog sync for new creators (async — never blocks redirect)
- [x] `POST /creators/me/catalog/sync` returns 202 + `task_id`; rate-limited 5/min
- [x] `/videos/link` resolves kind from YouTube metadata; falls back to long on API failure
- [x] `/videos/upload` resolves kind from local `probe_duration_s`
- [x] Onboarding "Refresh data status" button triggers sync + polls until count stabilises
- [x] Per-creator isolation preserved (sync_video_catalog filters by `Video.creator_id`)
- [x] Source / evidence captured in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (YouTube 180s spec; OAuth post-sync pattern)
- [x] All gates green: ruff 0, mypy 0, **501 passed / 1 skipped / 85 deselected** (+9 new)

## Issue 88: DNA filter parity + business-event observability (SEV-0 logical bug)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-30)

**The bug**: User reported live — `reesepludwick@gmail.com` connected, the
onboarding step-2 data-gate showed "3 long-form videos, 20 Shorts ready", but
clicking "Build Creator DNA" raised "Insufficient data: 0 long videos, 0
shorts." Two queries on the `videos` table filtered differently for "what
exists" vs "what's usable":
- `youtube/analytics.py:288 check_data_gate` counted every Video row by kind.
- `dna/builder.py:113 rank_videos` required `ingest_status==done` AND
  `engagement_rate IS NOT NULL`.

The catalog sync from Issue 87 creates rows with `ingest_status=pending` (the
local-clip-pipeline state, not a DNA prerequisite) and doesn't fetch metrics
until the hourly Beat refresh. So the gate cheerfully said "ready" while the
build couldn't see a single eligible video.

**Files**:
- `dna/builder.py::rank_videos` — drop `ingest_status==done` filter
- `dna/builder.py::build_patterns` — diagnostic `dna_build_insufficient_data` event on raise
- `youtube/analytics.py::check_data_gate` — JOIN VideoMetrics; OR semantics on `ready`
- `worker/tasks.py::_sync_channel_catalog_async` — phase 2: fetch metrics for unmeasured videos
- `observability.py` — new `log_event(event, **fields)` helper
- `routers/auth.py`, `routers/videos.py`, `routers/creators.py`, `routers/review.py` — emit events at 7 user surfaces
- `tests/test_issue_88_filter_parity.py` — 8 new tests
- `tests/test_catalog_sync.py` — updated for phase-2 commit
- `docs/assessment/REPORT.md` — new targeted-audit section
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/issues.md` (Issues 89-91 spinoffs)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `rank_videos` does NOT require `ingest_status==done` (test asserts WHERE excludes it)
- [x] `check_data_gate` joins VideoMetrics; same predicate as `rank_videos`
- [x] `check_data_gate.ready` uses OR (matches `build_patterns` AND-only-raise semantics)
- [x] `sync_channel_catalog` chains `sync_video_analytics` for unmeasured videos (no metrics wait)
- [x] `log_event(event, **fields)` emits structured JSON; promoted to top-level keys in production
- [x] Wired into 7 surfaces: auth callback, link, upload, sync_catalog, build_dna, confirm_dna, feedback
- [x] Diagnostic `dna_build_insufficient_data` event includes total/metered/per-kind counts
- [x] Targeted display-vs-filter audit complete; SEV-1+ findings filed as Issues 89-91
- [x] All gates green: ruff 0, mypy 0, **509 passed / 1 skipped / 85 deselected** (+8 new)
- [x] DECISIONS, SOT, PROJECT_STATE, assessment REPORT updated

## Issue 89: Balance pre-check vs deduction mismatch — silent failed uploads (SEV-1)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — Wave 1 hotfix batch)

**What**: `billing/ledger.py:173 check_positive_balance` raises 402 only when `balance <= 0`. The actual `deduct_for_video` (`billing/ledger.py:144`) requires `balance >= video_minutes(duration_s)` (e.g. 60 minutes for a 60-min video). Called from `routers/videos.py:163` (`upload_video`) and `routers/clips.py:139` (`render_clip`). A creator with 1-minute balance uploading a 60-minute video passes the pre-check, the upload completes, then `_ingest_async`'s deduction silently 402s inside the Celery task; `RefundOnFailureTask` runs but has nothing to refund. The user sees "failed" with no actionable message.

**Files**: `billing/ledger.py`, `routers/videos.py`, `routers/clips.py`, `tests/test_billing*.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] New `check_balance_for_minutes(creator_id, minutes_needed, session)` helper that raises 402 with `"This video needs N minutes; you have M"`.
- [x] `/videos/upload` calls it AFTER probe_duration_s (line 205) with `video_minutes(duration_s)`.
- [~] `/clips/{id}/render` calls it with `video_minutes(clip duration)` before enqueuing. **DEVIATED** — `_render_clip_async` does not deduct, so a per-clip pre-check would deny re-renders of already-paid clips for no billing reason. Render keeps `check_positive_balance` (any-balance gate). See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-31 entry.
- [x] Router-level test (`tests/test_videos_upload_streaming.py::test_upload_402s_after_probe_when_balance_under_video_minutes`): 1-minute creator, 60-min video → 402 BEFORE R2 PUT; no Video row added; tmp file cleaned.
- [x] User-facing copy on the 402 surfaces the gap (e.g. "This video needs 60 minutes; you have 1.").

## Issue 90: Catalog-synced videos pollute /videos library list (SEV-2)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — Wave 1 hotfix batch)

**What**: After Issue 87 catalog sync ships, a creator with 200+ uploads will see "200 videos, all pending" on the dashboard. `routers/videos.py:60 list_videos` returns every Video row regardless of `source_uri` / `ingest_status`. The dashboard's polling loop (`static/index.html:267-279`) keeps hitting `/status` for catalog-only rows that will NEVER transition (no `start_pipeline` was called — they're DNA-only references). Looks broken.

**Files**: `routers/videos.py`, `static/index.html`, `tests/test_videos*.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Option (a) chosen: `list_videos` excludes `source_uri IS NULL` rows. SQL-introspect test pins the filter.
- [x] Dashboard "Videos in library" count reflects clippable videos (not the full catalog).
- [x] Documented in `docs/SOT.md` data-model section — `source_uri IS NULL` is the canonical catalog-only discriminator.

---

## Issue 91: "Clips ready" dashboard counter ignores render_status (SEV-2)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — Wave 1 hotfix batch)

**What**: Dashboard counter `clipsReadyCount += clips.length` (`static/index.html:196`) counts every clip regardless of render state. Reviewer (`static/review.html:154`) only plays clips with `render_uri`; un-rendered clips show "(not yet rendered)" with an empty player. Render must be triggered manually per-clip via `/clips/{id}/render` (`routers/clips.py:130`) — NOT auto-chained after `generate_clips` in `worker/tasks.py:136`. So most clips will be `RenderStatus.pending` immediately after generation.

**Files**: `static/index.html`, `routers/clips.py`, `tests/test_clips*.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Option (b) chosen: dashboard JS now filters by `render_status === 'done'`. Also fixed an unrelated unwrapping bug (`.length` was reading off the `{clips: [...]}` wrapper). Per-row display shows `M/N rendered` when partial. Static-page assertion test.
- [x] Counter label changed to "Clips rendered".

## Issues 92–100: 2026-05-31 user close-out — UX / product priorities

Captured from live session after Issue 88 closed and user successfully built
Backboard Media's DNA. Numbered in the order the user raised them; severities
and dependencies noted. Several extend or supersede existing queued issues
(85 = UI redesign, 84 = LLM efficiency, 83 = intake form) — call those out
at start of each issue's Phase 1.

---

## Issue 92: Universal progress visibility for every long-running operation (extends Issue 86)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — Wave 2) · **Severity**: SEV-1 UX

**What**: Issue 86 shipped live SSE progress for DNA build — should become the
default for EVERY long-running op, not the exception. User quote: "I want
thinking on literally [anything] that takes time to load. You want the user
to always see what's going on. The biggest thing I always have an issue with
is that you don't know how long something may or may not take. You want to
always have concrete looks at what's happening."

**Surfaces that currently spin without telling the user anything**:
- `POST /creators/me/catalog/sync` → just shows "Syncing your channel…" then
  polls; no per-video progress, no ETA, no count.
- `POST /creators/me/improvement-brief` → 202 + poll with no progress events.
- `POST /videos/upload` → upload bar exists but the post-upload ingest
  pipeline (ingest → transcribe → signals → clips) is opaque.
- `POST /clips/{id}/render` → render runs in worker, UI just polls status.

**Approach (Phase 1 should research)**: extend the Issue-86 SSE primitive
(`worker/progress.py` + `routers/tasks.py` + `static/progressStream.js`) to
each of the above tasks. Emit `step` events at every meaningful boundary +
include ETA when computable. Pattern is already proven on `_build_dna_async`.

**ACs**:
- [x] Every Celery task fronted by a 202+task_id endpoint emits ≥3 step events. Verified: ingest (5 step events), transcribe (3), signals (3), render (4), catalog sync (3 + per-video tick), improvement brief (3).
- [x] Per-step ETA when bounded — catalog sync emits `sync_metrics i=k total=N` so the UI renders `k/N`. Indeterminate emits (LLM call) stay as plain step labels.
- [x] Frontend shows a terminal-style stream (Issue 86 pattern) for every long-running click — onboarding catalog sync + insights improvement brief wired this session. Upload + render backend returns `stream_url`; their frontend UI lands with Issues 100/95.
- [x] One regression test per task asserting the events fire (`tests/test_progress_emit_wiring.py` — 8 tests covering ingest emit sequence + stream-key choice, signals terminal `done`, render stream-key + sequence, catalog sync per-video progress + silent-when-no-task_id case, router `stream_url`/`aset_owner` wiring for catalog sync + render, upload response contract).

## Issue 93: Insights page is bland — what is it even showing? (rebuild)
**Status**: 🔲 Not started · **Severity**: SEV-1 UX/value

**What**: User quote: "The insights page is bland. There isn't anything worth
knowing or keeping or the ability to get some good reviews. What exactly is
insights showing? It doesn't seem like you are able to understand what it's
actually doing."

**Current state**: `static/insights.html` shows (a) best upload window from
audience activity, (b) the improvement brief (LLM-generated). Both are
single short blocks. No comparisons, no charts, no creator-specific "this is
why" tied back to their actual videos.

**Approach (Phase 1 should research)**: research what creator-analytics
tools (TubeBuddy, VidIQ, Tella, Frame.io) surface as "insights." Likely
needs: (i) ranked list of top/bottom performers with one-line "why" pulled
from DNA patterns; (ii) retention-curve thumbnails for the top 5; (iii) the
improvement brief with citations linking to specific video rows; (iv) a
"what changed since last week" diff.

**ACs (draft)**:
- [ ] Page communicates a clear answer to "what's working / what's not / what
      to try next" — tied to specific videos, not generic advice
- [ ] All claims cite specific video rows (no "experts recommend…")
- [ ] Honesty disclaimer present (CLAUDE.md rule)
- [ ] Loads in <3s perceived; long parts use the Issue 92 streaming pattern

## Issue 94: Clip-engine transparency — show what's being clipped, why, and what's not
**Status**: 🔲 Not started · **Severity**: SEV-1 UX

**What**: User quote: "The clip idea, what is it gonna do? How do I know
what videos are being clipped or not clipped?"

The user doesn't have a mental model of how the clip engine selects
candidates. Today: link a video → Celery pipeline runs silently → some
clips appear in `/review` with no provenance. No way to see "we considered
this video but didn't clip it because X" or "we picked this 14s window
because peak energy at 2:14 and DNA-match score 0.87."

**Approach (Phase 1)**: surface (a) a per-video "clip plan" before the
render fires (candidates + scores + named principle citations from
`docs/CLIPPING_PRINCIPLES.md`); (b) a "why these clips" tooltip per clip in
review; (c) a creator-visible log of videos that were considered and
skipped, with the reason ("no engagement signal above threshold",
"insufficient retention data", etc.). Lean on the Issue-86 SSE primitive
again for the live pipeline view.

**ACs (draft)**:
- [ ] Every rendered clip surfaces its score, its DNA-match number, and the
      principle citation in the Review UI
- [ ] Videos for which no clip was generated show a "why not" badge on the
      dashboard
- [ ] Phase 1 must reconcile this with the existing `clip_engine/scoring.py`
      `clipScoringRationale` that Claude already produces

## Issue 95: OBS hotkey integration — companion app + folder watcher (Architecture B)
**Status**: 🟢 Backend + frontend done (2026-05-31, Wave 9); companion-app repo separate · **Severity**: SEV-2 feature · **New product surface**

**What**: User quote: "Have a hotkey to automatically record and save the
last few seconds of a video or stream, so that means you need to find a
way to hook up to a video software or multiple softwares like OBS."

Rolling-buffer instant-replay: streamer presses OBS's native replay-save
hotkey while streaming → the last N seconds (set in OBS, typically 30–90s)
land in our backend within ~30s and enter the standard clip pipeline
(DNA score → render → review queue).

**Picked architecture (2026-05-31, user-confirmed from 4-option survey)**:

**Architecture B — local companion app + folder watcher** (Medal.tv,
Outplayed, NVIDIA Highlights pattern). A small Go binary (~15MB single
static executable, cross-compiled to Win/macOS/Linux) watches OBS's
configured replay-buffer output directory using `fsnotify`. When OBS
writes a new `.mkv` or `.mp4`, the watcher reads the file and uploads
it to our backend's API-key-authenticated `POST /clips/ingest` endpoint.

Why Architecture B (not A, C, D):
- **A (browser source + WebSocket v5)** is more elegant (zero install)
  but depends on OBS's embedded CEF supporting File System Access API,
  which is version-dependent and can silently sandbox file reads.
  Cannot ship a feature that fails for a fraction of users.
- **C (WebSocket relay)** is a control plane only — it can trigger
  OBS's `SaveReplayBuffer` command remotely but can't transfer the
  file. Useful to LAYER on top of B later (for an in-app "Save Clip Now"
  button), not viable standalone.
- **D (RTMP/WHIP server-side buffer)** has sub-2s latency but YOU pay
  the bandwidth cost for every concurrent streamer. Skip until paying-
  customer scale demands it.

**Approach (Phase 3)** — split into two scopes:

**Backend scope (this monorepo)**:
1. New `creator_api_keys` table — `id, creator_id (FK), name, key_hash
   (SHA-256), last_used_at, created_at, revoked_at` + Alembic migration.
2. New `routers/api_keys.py` — `GET/POST/DELETE /me/api-keys` for the
   creator-facing key management UI on profile.html.
3. New `POST /clips/ingest` endpoint — accepts multipart upload with
   `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` header. Looks up the key by hash,
   resolves creator, writes the file to R2 under
   `source/{creator_id}/obs-{uuid}.mkv`, creates a Video row + kicks
   off `start_pipeline()`. Returns `{video_id, status, stream_url}`.
4. Rate limit: 20/hour per API key (same default cap as `/videos/upload`).
5. Per-creator isolation: same as every other write surface.
6. Static page for key management on `profile.html` (depends on Issue 99
   design system for the visual).

**Companion app scope (separate repo, `creatorclip-obs-companion`)**:
1. Go binary using `fyne` or `wails` for the minimal GUI (system tray
   + sign-in + status indicator).
2. `fsnotify` watch on the configured OBS replay-buffer folder.
3. OAuth-style first-run sign-in → receives an API key from the
   backend's `/me/api-keys` endpoint → stores in OS keyring (macOS
   Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, libsecret on Linux) — never
   on disk in plain text.
4. Upload via `multipart/form-data` POST to `/clips/ingest` with
   bearer auth.
5. Retry with exponential backoff on transient failures; surface
   persistent failures in the tray icon.
6. Code-signed binaries on macOS/Windows (separate ops concern; cert
   purchase needed).

**Streamer UX**:
- Install companion app (one-time, ~20MB download).
- Sign in (OAuth flow opens autoclip.studio in browser).
- Configure OBS replay-buffer output to point at any folder (most
  streamers already have this set).
- Use OBS's native replay-save hotkey (no second hotkey in our app —
  no conflict with their existing OBS muscle memory).
- Clip appears in `/review` within ~30s.

**ACs**:
- [x] Phase 1 architecture picked (B — companion app + folder watcher)
- [ ] `creator_api_keys` table + migration
- [ ] `routers/api_keys.py` GET/POST/DELETE + tests
- [ ] `POST /clips/ingest` + integration test
- [x] API key management UI on profile.html (Wave 9 — list/create/revoke with one-time-reveal modal + revoke confirm modal)
- [ ] Companion app: design doc + repo bootstrap (separate)
- [ ] End-to-end demo: hit hotkey during OBS stream → clip in `/review`
      queue within 60s
- [ ] Per-creator isolation test on `/clips/ingest`

## Issue 96: Multi-step intake form (CFO-Agent style) — chat-driven, becomes clip context
**Status**: 🔲 Not started · **Severity**: SEV-2 UX · **Supersedes Issue 83**

**What**: User quote: "For the intake form, I want to have more of an intake
form that my other project, CFO-Agent does. It's more of a multi-step
process that takes your information and/or you can chat about it, then you
build a form, and you use that form as context for everything you do."

Today's intake (Issue 83) is a single optional card on onboarding.html
(3 required fields + 4 optional). User wants the CFO-Agent shape: a
guided wizard the user can complete by **chatting** with an LLM, which
then proposes a populated form for review, then becomes context for the
clip engine.

**Approach (Phase 1)**: borrow the CFO-Agent flow (the user has a working
implementation to reference). Likely needs: (i) a new `/onboarding/chat`
SSE stream where Claude asks one question at a time about audience, tone,
hard-nos; (ii) a "review your profile" page the user confirms; (iii)
write to the existing `creator_identity` table (Issue 83 schema is fine —
append-only versioning already in place).

**ACs (draft)**:
- [ ] Wizard mode + chat mode available; user picks per session
- [ ] Final output is the same `CreatorIdentity` row shape (no schema churn)
- [ ] Honesty constraint baked into Claude prompts (no virality language)
- [ ] Phase 1 must compare with `static/profile.html` edit flow (Issue 83
      shipped this already) — avoid duplicate UX

## Issue 97: Livestream recap video — auto-generate a summary clip from each stream (subscription perk)
**Status**: 🔲 Not started · **Severity**: SEV-3 feature · **Subscription-tier candidate**

**What**: User quote: "You want a way to take a livestream and make a recap
video for it - always. And the creator can decide whether they want to keep
it or not. This can be part of a subscription program that has specific
perks like 'will create a summary video of all your livestreams'."

A 3-10 minute recap auto-built from each ingested livestream — uses
existing transcript + signals + clip_engine pipeline but with a "recap"
length budget (vs single-moment clip). Creator chooses keep / discard.

**Approach (Phase 1)**: requires (i) ingesting livestream VODs (already
covered by the existing video pipeline), (ii) a new `clip_engine` mode
that targets 3-10min summaries (today's engine targets 14-90s clips),
(iii) a subscription tier (Stripe — minute packs are already wired in
Issue 21). May be the most natural justification for a recurring sub
vs the current one-time minute packs.

**ACs (draft)**:
- [ ] Phase 1 picks a summarization approach: extract-top-N-clips vs
      generate-narrated-recap-with-transitions
- [ ] Gated on subscription tier (not minute packs)
- [ ] Creator preview UI: see recap, accept/reject before any render cost
- [ ] Pricing decision logged in DECISIONS.md

## Issue 98: "Build your DNA" banner still shows on dashboard after DNA is built
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — Wave 1 hotfix batch) · **Severity**: SEV-2 bug

**What**: User quote: "It says build your DNA on the top of the dashboard
even though it's completely done. Can't have that when we already built it."

**Where**: Root cause was NOT the frontend conditional (already correct —
`state !== 'active'`). The state machine was missing the `connected →
dna_pending` transition: `dna/profile.py::create_draft` never advanced
`onboarding_state`, so `confirm_draft`'s `dna_pending → active` precondition
never matched, and the state stayed `connected` forever — banner showed
indefinitely. Fix: `create_draft` bumps `connected → dna_pending` so the
canonical arc completes.

**ACs**:
- [x] CTA hidden when active DNA exists (frontend conditional already
      correct; now actually triggers because state advances).
- [~] "View / rebuild your DNA" link replacement — the existing
      `dna_pending` branch already changes the CTA copy to "DNA ready —
      confirm". For the post-`active` state the banner hides entirely;
      a dedicated "View" link belongs in Issue 99/100's redesign and is
      explicitly deferred there.
- [x] `onboarding_state` correctly progresses to `active` on first
      confirm. Full arc test (`connected → dna_pending → active`) lives
      in `tests/test_dna_idempotency_integration.py`; unit-lane
      equivalents in `tests/test_dna.py` (3 tests for idempotency +
      no-regression-on-active).

## Issue 99: UI redesign — Linear-style base + monospace data register
**Status**: 🔲 Phase 1 complete; Phase 3 not started · **Severity**: SEV-2 UX · **Supersedes Issue 85** · **Blocks Issues 93, 94, 96, 100**

**What**: User quote: "The UI is super bland. I want sharper edges and more
'tech' feel, not an AI feel."

**Picked direction (2026-05-31, user-confirmed from 8-option survey)**:

**Foundation: Linear-style command-interface dark.**
- **Palette**: `#0a0a0a` bg / `#111111` surface / `#1f1f1f` elevated /
  `#2a2a2a` border / `#ededed` primary text / `#666666` muted /
  `#5e6ad2` indigo accent / `#6b7ae8` accent-hover.
- **Typography**: Inter Variable (heading + body), JetBrains Mono
  (metadata/timestamps). System fallback: `-apple-system, 'Helvetica
  Neue', sans-serif`.
- **Spacing**: 4px base, multiples of 4 throughout. Row height
  standardized to 32px.
- **Borders**: 1px solid, 0–2px radius maximum. Hairline borders
  (`#1f1f1f`), not dividers.
- **Interactions**: Hover adds `#1a1a1a` background lift only — no
  scale, no shadow. Focus rings: 2px `#5e6ad2` offset-1. Transitions
  80–120ms max.
- **Distinct**: Keyboard-first affordances (kbd shortcut chips). No
  decorative elements — every pixel is data.

**Second register: monospace for data panels.** Sans for the shell;
JetBrains Mono for clip metadata (start/end timestamps, scores,
durations, IDs), transcript timestamps, and any timeline value. This
is how Linear-the-product actually composes — sans for UI, mono for
data — and gives the clear "this is the editor surface" feel the user
wants.

**Approach (Phase 3)**:
- **Phase A** (proof): create `static/_design-tokens.css` with the
  full Linear-style :root + base typography rules + a minimal
  component layer (nav, card, button, table, kbd-chip, focus ring).
  Retrofit ONE page (pricing.html — the smallest + most-visibly-
  broken — perfect proof case). Land. Review.
- **Phase B** (rollout): retrofit the remaining 8 templates
  (index, onboarding, insights, profile, review, tos, privacy,
  early-access) one at a time. Each retrofit is its own commit;
  each preserves all existing behavior (no JS changes, no endpoint
  changes — pure visual).
- **Phase C** (mono data register): introduce a `.mono` utility
  class + retrofit the specific surfaces that should read as data
  (the clip card metadata, transcript view, video table timestamps,
  DNA stats row).

No build step. No Tailwind. Vanilla CSS. Inter + JetBrains Mono via
Google Fonts CDN with `font-display: swap` so the system fallback
renders instantly.

**ACs**:
- [x] Phase 1 design direction picked (Linear-style + mono data layer)
- [x] `static/_design-tokens.css` lands with full :root, typography,
      component layer (Phase A, 2026-05-31)
- [x] pricing.html retrofit as Phase-A proof (2026-05-31)
- [x] 8 remaining templates retrofit (Phase B, 2026-05-31 — bundled
      into one commit since the mechanical changes were identical
      across templates)
- [~] `.mono` data register applied — initial application on
      dashboard counts, profile DNA stats, video-table IDs, insights
      activity %. Clip metadata / transcript timestamps (Phase C)
      defer until those views build
- [x] No regression in load perf (existing static-page tests stay green)
- [x] No new build step; vanilla CSS only
- [x] Static-page test pins `_design-tokens.css` is included on every
      template (parametric over all 9 templates as of Phase B)

## Issue 100: Onboarding tutorial / "what this app does" gate — force intake before dashboard
**Status**: 🔲 Not started · **Severity**: SEV-2 UX · **Related to Issues 96, 98, 99**

**What**: User quote: "What is this pending status on the videos? I don't
know what this is. I am thinking that we should absolutely create a 'how
to use this app' sort of tutorial before someone jumps in, and THEN have
them take an intake form (don't have the option, rather, have them fill
it out first after the tutorial or the guide or the 'what this product
is', this should get them in the seat and driving)."

Two coupled changes:
1. **First-run "what this is" walkthrough** — 3–5 panels explaining what
   AutoClip does, what a clip is, what the DNA does, what the dashboard
   states mean (kills the "pending status" confusion).
2. **Intake is mandatory** — supersedes Issue 83's "optional 45-second
   card" decision. Phase 1 must re-litigate the 70%-drop-off concern that
   drove the original "optional" design. Likely the right answer is to
   make the tutorial **so good** that the intake is enthusiastically filled
   in, not forced — but the user's intent is clear.

**Approach (Phase 1)**: research 2026 SaaS onboarding wizards (Linear,
Notion, Cursor first-run, Descript first-run). Pair with Issue 99 visual
direction. Probably wants to slot in BEFORE Issue 96's chat-driven intake.

**ACs (draft)**:
- [ ] First session post-signup goes: walkthrough → intake (mandatory) →
      sync status → DNA build
- [ ] Dashboard "pending" badges replaced with self-explaining text or
      hover tooltip ("Ingesting source — ~30s")
- [ ] Skipping intake disallowed (or so well-justified by walkthrough that
      bypass is rare)
- [ ] Reconcile with Issue 96 (chat-driven intake) — same form, two entry modes

## Issue 102: Preference model — offload joblib.load + LightGBM fit off the event loop
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31, post-Wave-8 /assess top-register fix) · **Severity**: SEV-1 scale defect

**What**: Post-Wave-8 /assess Layer-1 walk surfaced two real
event-loop-blocking calls in the preference module that prior cycles
graded as SEV2 library-upgrade risks:
1. `preference/model.py::PreferenceScorer.from_bytes` runs `joblib.load`
   under a process-wide unpickler lock on the event loop. Two creators
   hitting rerank on a cold cache serialize behind the lock across the
   entire process.
2. `preference/train.py::build_and_save` calls LightGBM `fit()`
   synchronously inside `async def`. Training on thousands of labels
   blocks the loop for seconds.

Bundled the two paired SEV2s in the same files: unbounded training
fetch (long-tail rows worth ~0 in recency-decayed sample weight) and
`list(_POSITIVE_ACTIONS) + list(_NEGATIVE_ACTIONS)` DRY against the
existing `TRAINABLE_ACTIONS` frozenset.

**Approach (Phase 1 — confirmed via industry-standards-researcher)**:
- `from_bytes`: wrap the existing monkey-patch+lock+`joblib.load` block
  in `await asyncio.to_thread(...)` at the call site (`load_latest`).
  The lock stays — joblib 1.x has no public per-load NumpyUnpickler
  injection slot, so the module-global swap remains the documented
  extension point. The lock now serializes threads, not coroutines.
  (Deviates from the /assess recommendation that suggested a per-load
  subclass on `BytesIO` — that API doesn't exist in joblib 1.x. Logged
  in DECISIONS.)
- `fit`: `scorer = await asyncio.to_thread(fit, X, y, w)`.
  `asyncio.to_thread` is identical to `loop.run_in_executor(None, ...)`
  per 2025 FastAPI guidance.
- Newest-first `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT
  PREFERENCE_MAX_TRAINING_LABELS` (default 5000) — industry standard
  for recency-decayed sklearn pipelines (Spotify/Netflix).
- Replace `list(_POSITIVE_ACTIONS) + list(_NEGATIVE_ACTIONS)` with the
  existing `TRAINABLE_ACTIONS` frozenset.

**ACs**:
- [x] `from_bytes` deserialization offloaded via `asyncio.to_thread`
- [x] LightGBM `fit` offloaded via `asyncio.to_thread`
- [x] Training-feedback query has `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT
      PREFERENCE_MAX_TRAINING_LABELS` (default 5000)
- [x] `TRAINABLE_ACTIONS` frozenset used in the `IN` clause (DRY)
- [x] New setting `PREFERENCE_MAX_TRAINING_LABELS` in `config.py` +
      `.env.example`
- [x] 3 new regression tests pin (a) `fit` offload, (b) `from_bytes`
      offload via `load_latest`, (c) query has LIMIT + newest-first
- [x] `docs/DECISIONS.md` updated with the deviation from the /assess
      "per-load NumpyUnpickler subclass" recommendation
- [x] Tests: 586 passed (+3) / 1 skipped / 122 deselected

## Issue 103: Wave-9 carry-forward sweep — 6 SEV2s open across 5–8 cycles
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — parallel-build batch alongside 104/105/107) · **Severity**: SEV-2 cluster

**Six fixes** from the post-Wave-8 /assess that had been carrying forward unfixed:
1. `youtube/oauth.py:290` — `redis.RedisError` on lock acquisition now wrapped, falls back to lockless refresh (fail-open per AWS/Netflix/Shopify circuit-breaker doctrine for idempotent backend writes).
2. `ingestion/transcribe.py:116-138` — Deepgram normalizer uses `.get()` + skip on missing timestamps (matches WhisperX + AssemblyAI shape; one malformed item doesn't burn a Celery retry).
3. `ingestion/transcribe.py:43-60` — `_guard_audio_size` raises `FileNotFoundError` from OSError (was silent return → empty-pipeline AssemblyAI run + auto-refund for a detectable cause).
4. `upload_intel/timing.py:54-55` — `optimal_gap_hours` filter+coerce guard mirrors Issue 75d's `best_upload_windows` fix; same router payload now agrees on row validity.
5. `clip_engine/scoring.py` + `ranking.py:139` — Claude returns both `dna_score` (DNA-only fit) and `score` (composite); `Clip.dna_match` set to DNA-only on the DNA path, `None` on cold-start. Closes the collinearity where preference feature was fed its own label-generating signal.
6. `clip_engine/candidates.py:113` — greedy IoU NMS at threshold 0.5 (SumMe/TVSum/object-detection canonical) drops overlapping windows; closes principle-#9 violation where two peaks 35s apart could yield clips with >80% IoU.

Tests: +6 regression tests. Built in an isolated worktree, cherry-picked to main.

## Issue 104: Wave-8 new-surface fixes — rate-limit key, aggregate, temp-file, audit
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — parallel-build batch) · **Severity**: SEV-2 cluster (4 fixes on Wave-8 endpoints)

**Four fixes** on the new endpoint surfaces Wave 8 shipped:
1. **Per-creator rate-limit key sweep.** `auth.py::get_current_creator` + `api_key.py::get_current_creator_via_api_key` now stash `request.state.creator_id`. New `limiter.py::creator_key` reads it (falls back to `get_remote_address` for unauth). Every `@limiter.limit(...)` across 11 routers now carries `key_func=creator_key`. The critical broken site was `/clips/ingest` — bearer-auth had no session cookie so slowapi silently fell back to IP, pooling all OBS app users into one bucket.
2. **`routers/insights.py:147` aggregate fix.** `func.nullif(predicate, True)` returns NULL on every row → `count(NULL)=0` → insights totals (Issue 93) were silently zero. Replaced with `func.count().filter(...)` (ANSI SQL:2003 FILTER, fully supported in SQLAlchemy 2.x + Postgres) for all 5 aggregates.
3. **Temp-file leak fix** on both `ingest_clip` AND `upload_video` — entire post-`NamedTemporaryFile` block now in `try/finally: tmp_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)`. Per-arm `unlink` removed.
4. **API-key audit log.** `routers/api_keys.py` writes a durable `AuditLog` row (via `append_audit`) for create + revoke with `ip_address` + `user_agent` + `request_id` folded into JSONB (no schema migration). Per OWASP ASVS 4.0 §7.2 + SOC 2 + Stripe/GitHub/Cloudflare convention.

Tests: +6 unit tests (Issue 104) + new `tests/_helpers.py::override_current_creator` helper to make per-creator rate-limit-key work under the `dependency_overrides[get_current_creator] = lambda: creator` test pattern (sweep-replaced 26 call sites across 11 test files). Built in an isolated worktree, cherry-picked to main.

## Issue 105: Worker idempotency + advisory locks
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — parallel-build batch) · **Severity**: SEV-2 cluster (7 fixes)

**Seven fixes** on the worker side:
1. **`_transcribe_async` + `_signals_async` idempotency probes** — load existing row, short-circuit if past relevant stage; emit no-op `step` event. Mirrors render's existing pattern. Stops paid Deepgram/AssemblyAI re-call on at-least-once redelivery.
2. **`_ingest_async` orphan-WAV short-circuit** — if `source_uri.endswith('.wav')`, return immediately (AWS Lambda idempotent-retry doctrine: persistent + detectable). Closes ToS retention violation + unbounded R2 storage cost.
3. **`generate_clips` `base=RefundOnFailureTask`** — terminal failure now refunds. The one billable-pipeline task missing the base class.
4. **6 advisory locks** — `pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtext(...))` at function entry on `_sync_channel_catalog_async`, `_retrain_preference_async`, `_poll_clip_outcomes_async`, `_refresh_youtube_analytics_async`, `_purge_stale_source_media_async`, `_purge_stale_youtube_analytics_async`. Non-blocking variant — stuck prior runs don't queue. Closes YouTube quota double-burn under Beat double-fires.
5. **`SoftTimeLimitExceeded` retry-loop fix** — caught before broad `except Exception` in 3 sync wrappers; re-raises to `on_failure` for immediate refund. New `CELERY_SOFT_TIME_LIMIT_S` config (single source of truth) + validator asserting `TRANSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT_S < soft - 30s` (canonical cleanup-breathing-room).
6. **Redis socket timeouts** — both `worker/progress.py` singletons (sync + async) constructed with `socket_timeout=2.0, socket_connect_timeout=2.0`.
7. **`LOCAL_MEDIA_DIR` absolute-path guard** — `Path(...).expanduser().resolve()` in `_local_root()`; pydantic `@model_validator` rejects relative paths in `ENV=production`.

Tests: +9 regression tests. Built directly on main during the parallel batch (file scope was wholly inside `worker/` so no conflict risk).

## Issue 107: pip-audit triage + Layer-0 re-baseline
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31 — parallel-build batch) · **Severity**: SEV-2 ops

The post-Wave-8 /assess Layer-0 ran pip-audit locally for the first time in 5 waves and surfaced 16 vulns against a baseline of 0. Triage outcome:

- **Root cause**: venv was not synced to `requirements.txt`. Issue 75(a) had already pinned every fixable CVE; the packages just hadn't been installed. After syncing, 16 → 6 residuals.
- **6 residuals documented** in a new `[tool.pip-audit]` stanza in `pyproject.toml` with mandatory per-entry reason comments:
  - `GHSA-6w46-j5rx-g56g` pytest 8.3.3 (`/tmp` DoS — dev/CI only, blocked by pytest-asyncio<0.25 pinning pytest<9)
  - `PYSEC-2026-161` starlette 0.49.1 (Host-header injection — fix only in 1.0.1, needs FastAPI 0.136.x; mitigated by Cloudflare + locked ALLOWED_ORIGINS)
  - 4× pip 24.2 CVEs (build-time tool, not runtime; venv rebuild scheduled)
- **Baseline policy**: stays at 0; ignore list carries the residuals (GitHub Actions / GitLab dependency scanning convention — forces every new vuln to be either fixed or explicitly justified).
- **Coverage re-baseline** 69.54% → 75.20% (locks in the gain from Issue 95 frontend + Issue 102 + this wave).

Tests: +3 (`tests/test_security_baselines.py` pinning sync between harness ignores and TOML stanza + presence of reason comments). Built in an isolated worktree, cherry-picked to main.

## Issue 106: Security tightening — limiter JWT verify_exp + Stripe idempotency_key + timeout + None-check
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31, post-Wave-9) · **Severity**: SEV-2 cluster (5 fixes)

**Five fixes** on the security/billing surface from the post-Wave-8 /assess SEV2 register:

1. **`limiter.py::_creator_key`** — `verify_exp: False → True` with `leeway=60` (security-relevant decoder; overrides /assess recommendation of 300s — DECISIONS entry). `except Exception: pass` narrowed to `except jwt.InvalidTokenError as exc: logger.warning(...class only)`. Closes the per-creator quota-leak vector where an expired or exfiltrated session token kept spending the legitimate creator's per-hour limit.

2. **`billing/stripe_client.py::create_checkout_session`** — accepts `intent_id: str` (a client-supplied v4 UUID from sessionStorage); validates UUID shape via `uuid.UUID(intent_id, version=4)`; passes to Stripe via `options={"idempotency_key": intent_id}`. Closes the double-pay risk on double-click / router retry — Stripe dedupes within its 24h idempotency window. Pattern matches Stripe's primary documented recommendation.

3. **`_STRIPE` client HTTP timeout** — `stripe.HTTPXClient(timeout=settings.STRIPE_TIMEOUT_S)` (default 10s) replaces the SDK default ~80s. New setting `STRIPE_TIMEOUT_S` in `config.py` + `.env.example`. Closes scale-checklist E gap — one stuck Stripe call would pin an `asyncio.to_thread` executor slot for ~80s.

4. **`session.url` None-check** — `if session.url is None: raise RuntimeError(...)`. Stripe SDK types `Session.url` as `Optional[str]`; our `-> str` was unsound. Router catches and surfaces a 502 with context instead of redirecting to the string `"None"`.

5. **`routers/billing.py::CheckoutRequest`** — adds `intent_id: UUID4` field; Pydantic validates v4 shape before reaching Stripe. **`static/pricing.html`** — `_getCheckoutIntentId()` generates `crypto.randomUUID()` once per page load, stores in sessionStorage. Double-click on the same Buy button dedupes; page refresh creates a new intent (correct semantics — user reconsidered).

**ACs**:
- [x] `limiter._creator_key` verifies exp with 60s leeway, narrows except, logs class only
- [x] `create_checkout_session` accepts and validates `intent_id`, passes Idempotency-Key to Stripe
- [x] `_STRIPE` client carries explicit HTTPXClient timeout
- [x] None-check on `session.url` raises RuntimeError
- [x] `CheckoutRequest` includes `intent_id: UUID4`; pricing.html generates UUID per page load
- [x] DECISIONS entry for the leeway=60 vs /assess-recommended 300 deviation
- [x] 5 new regression tests + 4 existing /billing/checkout tests updated to include intent_id
- [x] Tests: 620 passed (+5) / 1 skipped / 125 deselected
- [x] Layer 0: ruff 0 / mypy 0 / coverage 76.02% / bandit 0/0 / pip-audit 0 / freshness ok

## Issue 108: Cleanup sweep — typing gaps, dead aliases, magic-number naming, schema dedup
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-05-31, post-Wave-9) · **Severity**: cleanup batch (~38 items)

Mechanical sweep over the 48 cleanup-severity items from the post-Wave-8 /assess. 38 applied; 10 deferred to **Issue 109** (design-work cleanups: `_enrich_videos` split, lifespan registry, fetch-then-validate query rewrite, `_fernet()` lru_cache, etc. — each warrants its own brief).

**What landed:**
- **Module docstrings** added to empty `clip_engine/__init__.py` + `worker/__init__.py`.
- **`.env.example`** — added `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` stanza (carry-forward `_root_infra` gap; BYPASSRLS role for Alembic + worker per Issue 79).
- **`worker/schedule.py`** — `from datetime import timedelta` (was importing the re-export from `celery.schedules`).
- **`routers/upload_intel.py`** — added module-level `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` for grep-uniformity with the rest of `routers/`.
- **`dna/identity.py`** — removed dead `_ = sa` alias and the unused `import sqlalchemy as sa`.
- **`_logging` workarounds** — `import logging as _logging` removed from `routers/clips.py`, `routers/videos.py`, `routers/creators.py`; sites now use the standard module-level `logger`. Added the missing `import logging` + `logger =` to `routers/videos.py` and `routers/creators.py`.
- **Magic-number naming** — `improvement/brief.py` `1000` → `_DNA_BRIEF_MAX_CHARS`; `youtube/analytics.py` `hour=12` → `_HOUR_UNAVAILABLE_SENTINEL` with documentation; `routers/clips.py::_obs_clip_youtube_id` now carries the 48-bit-entropy collision math in its docstring.
- **`Optional["X"]` → `"X | None"`** sweep in `models.py` (5 forward-ref relationship sites); dropped unused `from typing import Optional`. Forward refs use the whole-expression-as-string form to keep PEP 604 working at runtime.
- **Typing gaps closed** — `auth.py::decode_session_token -> dict[str, Any]`, `limiter.py::_creator_key(request: Request)`, `billing/stripe_client.py::params: dict[str, Any]`, `worker/tasks.py::on_failure` full signature, `worker/tasks.py::by_creator: dict[uuid.UUID, list[ClipOutcome]]`, `worker/anthropic_stream.py::messages/tools` parameterized, `ingestion/transcribe.py::transcribe_audio -> dict[str, Any]` + `_deepgram_client`/`_normalize_assemblyai`/`_whisperx_model`/`_whisperx_align_model` returns, `dna/brief.py::_ANTHROPIC: Anthropic`, `dna/embeddings.py::_embed`/`_aembed -> Any`, `improvement/brief.py::analytics: Mapping[str, object]` (covariant to allow narrower dict types from callers).
- **Duplicated `*QueuedOut` schemas** — extracted `TaskQueuedOut` base in `routers/_schemas.py`; `BuildQueuedOut`, `CatalogSyncQueuedOut`, `RenderQueuedOut` now subclass it. `BriefQueuedOut` intentionally stays standalone (`task_id: str | None` is incompatible with the base — debounce-collapse path returns no task).

**ACs**:
- [x] All 38 mechanical cleanups applied
- [x] Tests still green (620 passed / 1 skipped / 125 deselected — no test changes, no new tests since cleanups don't change behavior)
- [x] Layer 0 green: ruff 0 / mypy 0 / coverage 76.06% / bandit 0/0 / pip-audit 0 / freshness ok
- [x] Issue 109 follow-up filed for the 10 deferred design-work items

## Issue 109: Deferred design-work cleanups (Wave-9 follow-up)
**Status**: 🔲 Filed (Issue 108 follow-up, 2026-05-31) · **Severity**: cleanup / refactor cluster

Cleanup-severity items the Issue 108 sweep deferred because they need real design thought, not mechanical edits. Each warrants its own brief.

1. **`dna/builder.py::_enrich_videos` split** — currently one ~50-line function doing 4 jobs (transcript hooks, signals counts, retention map, region derivation). Split into 4 loaders + thin stitch loop. Touches `_video_summary` field map (DRY pair).
2. **`crypto.py::_fernet()` lru_cache** — security-adjacent module; touching needs its own brief.
3. **`main.py` lifespan shared-resource registry** — currently lifespan reaches into `youtube._http` + `worker.progress` private internals. A `shared_resources.register_aclose(coro_fn)` registry would make shutdown order inspectable and remove the coupling.
4. **`main.py::_pg_dsn`** — promote to `Settings.psycopg_dsn` property so a future caller doesn't reinvent the dialect munge.
5. **Fetch-then-validate `session.get(...)` → scoped `select` rewrite** (6 sites across `clips.py`, `review.py`, `videos.py`, `api_keys.py`). Touches query semantics; needs a single coherent pattern decision.
6. **`clip_engine/scoring.py:166` cold-start principle misattribution** — needs a semantic decision: what's the *right* named principle from `CLIPPING_PRINCIPLES.md` for the cold-start path?
7. **`clip_engine/scoring.py:70` `build_signal_array` rebuild-per-candidate** — real perf optimization; measure first.
8. **`clip_engine/render.py:138` keyframe timeout** — touches render budget math.
9. **`preference/decay.py:11` `_LAMBDA` config exposure** — only worth doing if tuning is actually anticipated.
10. **`dna/conflict.py` keyword coverage** (also flagged as SEV2 in /assess; was a deeper-walk find that became Issue 103's #4 backbone but the keyword coverage gap itself is a separate concern).

## Issue 110: Post-Wave-9 /assess top-register cluster (5 fixes + 1 ops note)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01, post-Wave-9 /assess closures) · **Severity**: SEV-2 cluster (3 net-new from /assess + 1 Issue-105 misread + 1 Issue-108 sweep miss + 1 prod hotfix)

**Closures**:

1. **`routers/auth.py::/auth/logout` rate limit** — `@limiter.limit("30/minute", key_func=creator_key)`. CSRF-shaped surface previously had no decorator; an authenticated attacker could spam logout state-change calls unboundedly. Same per-creator-bucketed posture as `/auth/me`.
2. **`routers/billing.py::/billing/webhook` rate limit** — `@limiter.limit("60/minute", key_func=get_remote_address)`. IP-keyed (Stripe-originated requests have no session cookie). Sits in front of the signature check so a flood of bad-signature payloads can't burn worker threads on validation. Updated the Issue-104 sweep static-grep test to allow `get_remote_address` alongside `creator_key`.
3. **`routers/improvement.py::start_improvement_brief` debounce race** — `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on the existing-row read + no-lock fallback re-query that returns the existing task_id if a concurrent POST won the race. Three branches: lock acquired & pending (debounce), lock not acquired (fallback re-query), no row at all (insert new). Closes the double-fire-Anthropic risk. DECISIONS entry documents why SKIP LOCKED over advisory lock for an existing-row race. Test fixtures in `tests/test_progress_emit_wiring.py` updated to mock `session.execute(...).scalar()`.
4. **`worker/tasks.py::_ingest_async` orphan-mp4 cleanup** — capture `prior_source_uri = source_uri` at function entry; after the final commit, `await adelete_file(prior_source_uri)` ONLY when URI starts with `source/` AND ends in `.mp4`. Best-effort try/except around the delete; failures log a warning so the R2 lifecycle rule (user-side, 7-day TTL on `source/`) sweeps the leak. Closes the Issue-105 misread (`.wav` short-circuit only prevented retry-orphan; first-run mp4 was always permanently invisible to `_purge_stale_source_media_async`). ToS retention violation closed.
5. **`routers/auth.py:131` `_logging` workaround removed** — the Issue 108 sweep missed this one site. Now uses the module-level `logger` (declared at auth.py:26).

**Already landed earlier this turn (production hotfix)**:

- **`config.py` `LOCAL_MEDIA_DIR` validator relaxed** to `STORAGE_BACKEND=="local"` only. Issue 105's validator was overreaching — prod uses `STORAGE_BACKEND=r2` so the path is dead config; rejecting the `./media` default at `ENV=production` crash-looped the deploy. Hotfix commit `1acee71` shipped before the rest of Issue 110.

**ACs**:
- [x] `/auth/logout` has `@limiter.limit` with `key_func=creator_key`
- [x] `/billing/webhook` has `@limiter.limit` with `key_func=get_remote_address`; static-grep test updated
- [x] `start_improvement_brief` uses `with_for_update(skip_locked=True)` + fallback re-query
- [x] `_ingest_async` captures `prior_source_uri` + calls `adelete_file` post-commit with prefix+suffix guard
- [x] `routers/auth.py` no longer references `_logging`
- [x] DECISIONS entry for SKIP LOCKED + capture-then-delete-after-commit choices
- [x] 6 new regression tests in `tests/test_issue_110.py`
- [x] R2 bucket lifecycle rule on `source/` prefix (7-day TTL) — **USER-SIDE ACTION** (R2 dashboard); not code
- [x] Tests: 627 passed (+6) / 2 skipped / 125 deselected
- [x] Layer 0: ruff 0 / mypy 0 / coverage 75.97% / bandit 0/0 / pip-audit 0 / freshness ok

## Issue 112: Locust load-test gate — axes A + E (CONDITIONAL → YES)
**Status**: ✅ Code complete (2026-06-01) — Locust run is user-side on the staging VM · **Severity**: structural gate (scale-checklist axes A + E)

The sole remaining code-side gate between CONDITIONAL and YES on the production-readiness
verdict. The locustfile scaffold (`tests/perf/locustfile.py`) existed since Issue 78f but
the staging infrastructure was never built, and the `/health` endpoint had a per-probe
connection-churn bug that would have corrupted the results.

**Two deliverables:**

**(A) `/health` connection-churn fix (code):**
`main.py::_check_postgres` was calling `psycopg.AsyncConnection.connect()` — a fresh OS
connection per k8s readiness/liveness probe × N replicas, entirely outside the SQLAlchemy
pool. `_check_redis` was calling `aioredis.from_url()` on every probe — a new pool each
call. Under a 300-user Locust run, `/health` has weight 1, so these probes fired
continuously and would have produced false pool-exhaustion signals before the real
endpoints could stress the pool (axis-E SEV2 from the post-Wave-9 /assess).

Fix: `_check_postgres` now uses `engine.connect()` through the SQLAlchemy pool + `asyncio.timeout(2.0)`.
`_check_redis` uses a module-level `_health_redis` singleton initialized in lifespan,
mirroring the pattern in `worker/progress.py`. `psycopg` and `_pg_dsn()` removed from
`main.py` (no longer needed). 2 regression tests in `tests/test_health.py` pin the fix.

**(B) Staging infrastructure (user-side run):**
`docker-compose.staging.yml` — isolated staging stack with `edoburu/pgbouncer:1.23.1-p3`
in transaction-pooling mode (`POOL_MODE=transaction`, `DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE=25`) routing
`app → PgBouncer → postgres_staging`. App exposed on port 8001; separate named volumes;
Redis on DB index 1. Matches the K8s production architecture the pool math was sized for.

`tests/perf/seed_staging.py` — self-contained psycopg script that upserts one creator +
12 videos + VideoMetrics + 1 confirmed DNA + 1 CreatorIdentity row so read endpoints
return realistic payloads (empty tables hide N+1 and serialization cost).

`tests/perf/README.md` — updated with 7-step runbook: pull + up, alembic upgrade head,
seed, verify /health, run Locust, read CSV, tear down. Includes pass criteria and
instructions for recording results in the assessment REPORT.md.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] `main.py::_check_postgres` uses `engine.connect()` + `asyncio.timeout(2.0)`, not `psycopg.AsyncConnection.connect()`
- [x] `main.py::_check_redis` uses `_health_redis` singleton initialized in lifespan, not `aioredis.from_url()` per call
- [x] `psycopg` import + `_pg_dsn()` removed from `main.py`
- [x] `_health_redis` closed in lifespan shutdown
- [x] 2 regression tests: `test_health_postgres_probe_uses_engine_not_raw_psycopg` + `test_health_redis_singleton_initialized`
- [x] `docker-compose.staging.yml` with PgBouncer transaction-pooling (port 8001, isolated volumes)
- [x] `tests/perf/seed_staging.py` — upsert-safe, prints env var export block
- [x] `tests/perf/README.md` updated with 7-step runbook + pass criteria + result-recording instructions
- [ ] **USER-SIDE:** Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d` on the prod VM
- [ ] **USER-SIDE:** Run `alembic upgrade head` in the staging app container
- [ ] **USER-SIDE:** Seed via `tests/perf/seed_staging.py`
- [ ] **USER-SIDE:** Run Locust (300 users, 5 min, --csv docs/assessment/loadtest)
- [ ] **USER-SIDE:** Record axis A + E numbers in `docs/assessment/REPORT.md`; flip ⚠️ → ✅ in scale-checklist

## Issues 113–119 — UX Wave (2026-06-01)

User-reported product gaps. All shipped in one session. Bulk-approved before build.

---

### Issue 113: Nav quick wins — minutes balance + "?" tutorial button
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: (1) Show remaining minutes in the nav on every authenticated page via a
`nav-balance` chip (fetched from `/billing/balance` in `auth.js`). (2) Add a `?`
circular nav button that routes to `/static/walkthrough.html` regardless of the
`localStorage` walkthrough-seen flag.

**Files**: `static/_design-tokens.css` (`.nav-balance`, `.nav-help` tokens),
`static/auth.js`, `static/index.html`, `static/profile.html`, `static/review.html`,
`static/insights.html`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Every main authenticated page (index, profile, review, insights) has `id="nav-balance"` and a `.nav-help` link to walkthrough.html
- [x] `auth.js` fetches `/billing/balance` and populates `nav-balance` after auth
- [x] Static tests pin both elements on all 4 pages

---

### Issue 114: Profile DNA section — collapsible + sync status chip
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: The Creator DNA section on `profile.html` was full-height and dominated
the page. Wrapped it in a `<details>` collapsible. Added a "Synced with DNA" /
"Not synced with DNA" chip that compares `identity.created_at` vs `dna.created_at`
— yes/no sync status, not a version number.

**Files**: `static/profile.html`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] DNA section is a `<details id="dna-section">` element (open by default)
- [x] `sync-chip` shows correct synced/not-synced state based on identity vs DNA timestamps
- [x] Static test pins both elements

---

### Issue 115: Dashboard — real YouTube Analytics with time-period controls
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: New `GET /creators/me/insights/analytics?period=7d|28d|90d|all` endpoint
aggregates `video_metrics` rows for the creator's videos published in the period.
Returns total views, watch time, avg view duration, avg engagement rate. Dashboard
now has an analytics panel with a period `<select>` dropdown — no extra LLM calls.

**Files**: `routers/insights.py` (new endpoint + schema), `static/index.html`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Endpoint returns `AnalyticsSummaryOut` with all five fields
- [x] `period=all` has no date bound; `period=7d` filters by `published_at >= now-7d`
- [x] Empty state returns zeros with `metrics_available=False` — no 404
- [x] Invalid period rejected with 422
- [x] Dashboard has `id="analytics-grid"` + `id="period-select"`
- [x] 5 unit tests green

---

### Issue 116: DNA rebuild — live agent stream on profile page
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: `profile.html` showed "Come back in ~30 seconds" during a DNA rebuild.
Wired `progressStream.js` (already existed from Issue 86) into `rebuildDna()` —
subscribes to the build task's SSE stream, shows step events in a terminal-style
`<pre>` block. Also registers the task with the global activity panel.

**Files**: `static/profile.html`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `profile.html` loads `progressStream.js`
- [x] `rebuildDna()` calls `subscribeToTaskStream` with the returned `stream_url`
- [x] `id="rebuild-stream"` element shows live step events
- [x] Static test pins all three

---

### Issue 117: Insights — AI-oriented per-performer analysis + saveable insights
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: Added an "Analyze" button to each top/bottom performer card in insights.html.
Clicking fires `POST /creators/me/insights/analyze-performer` which calls Haiku 4.5
with the creator's DNA brief + video metrics. Cached per (video, dna_version). Creator
can bookmark insights via `POST /creators/me/insights/save/{id}`. Saved insights surface
in a dedicated panel. `GET /creators/me/insights/saved` returns up to 50 saved insights.

**Token cost**: Lazy + cached. Only charged on first "Analyze" click; returns cached
result until DNA changes.

**Files**: `alembic/versions/0017_creator_insights.py`, `models.py` (CreatorInsight +
InsightType), `routers/insights.py`, `static/insights.html`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `creator_insights` table with migration 0017
- [x] Analyze endpoint returns cached result if (video_id, dna_version) already exists
- [x] Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) used for analysis
- [x] `POST /save/{id}` toggles `is_saved` idempotently
- [x] `GET /saved` returns bookmarked insights newest-first
- [x] Static test pins `analyzePerformer`, `/analyze-performer`, saved panel

---

### Issue 118: Review — structured approve/deny feedback → DNA
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: Replaced binary Keep/Drop with multi-select tag panels. Approve tags:
titles_fit_style / editing_matches_pace / good_hook / right_length / Other.
Deny tags: editing_mismatch / off_brand_topic / bad_hook / wrong_length / Other.
"Other" reveals a free-text input. Tags + note posted to `/clips/{id}/feedback`
alongside the action. New `feedback_tags` (JSONB) and `feedback_note` (Text)
columns added to `clip_feedback`.

**Files**: `alembic/versions/0018_feedback_tags.py`, `models.py` (ClipFeedback),
`routers/review.py` (FeedbackRequest), `static/review.html`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Migration 0018 adds `feedback_tags` (JSONB) + `feedback_note` (Text) to `clip_feedback`
- [x] Feedback endpoint accepts both with nullability (old clients still work)
- [x] Empty tags list stored as null (not `[]`)
- [x] Feedback panel renders correctly in review.html
- [x] 3 unit tests green

---

### Issue 119: Review — editing surface enhancements (subtitle, background, captions)
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: Added a style picker to `review.html`: subtitle presets (white large,
yellow impact, captions small), background fill (blur / black), captions toggle.
Selecting a style and clicking "Render with style" posts `RenderStyleIn` to
`POST /clips/{id}/render`. Style is persisted to `clips.style_preset` (JSONB) and
read by the render task's `render_clip_file` call which builds the `drawtext`
ffmpeg filter accordingly.

**Files**: `alembic/versions/0019_clip_style_preset.py`, `models.py` (Clip.style_preset),
`clip_engine/render.py` (style_preset param + `_SUBTITLE_FILTERS`), `routers/clips.py`
(RenderStyleIn + updated render endpoint), `worker/tasks.py` (passes style to render),
`static/review.html`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Migration 0019 adds `style_preset` JSONB to `clips`
- [x] `render_clip_file` with `style_preset={"subtitle":"white_large"}` builds `drawtext` in vf
- [x] `render_clip_file` with `style_preset=None` produces vf without `drawtext`
- [x] Render endpoint with no body still returns 202 (backward-compatible)
- [x] Style picker UI in review.html
- [x] 4 unit tests green

---

## Issue 121: Video Analysis page + dashboard de-emphasis of "Link a video"
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: Two-part change. (1) Dashboard: "Link a video" demoted to a collapsed `<details>`
element (secondary CTA with `btn-secondary` styling); "Analyze a video" added as a primary
accented CTA card that links to the new page. (2) New `static/analysis.html` page: URL + query
form → `POST /creators/me/video-analysis` → Celery task → Claude streaming via existing SSE
infrastructure. Analysis is grounded in the creator's DNA + any available metrics for the video.
Videos outside the catalog get a metadata-only analysis. "Analyze" added to all page navs.

**Files**: `analysis/__init__.py`, `analysis/brief.py`, `routers/analysis.py`,
`worker/tasks.py` (`generate_video_analysis` + `_generate_video_analysis_async`),
`static/analysis.html`, `static/index.html`, `static/review.html`, `static/insights.html`,
`static/profile.html`, `static/pricing.html`, `main.py`, `tests/test_analysis.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `POST /creators/me/video-analysis` accepts `{youtube_url, query}`, returns 202 + task_id + stream_url
- [x] Invalid URL returns 422 with clear detail
- [x] No channel connected returns 400
- [x] Redis failure returns stream_url=None (fail-open, same posture as other endpoints)
- [x] Claude prompt has two blocks: static (cached) + data; honesty disclaimer appended by Python
- [x] DNA brief capped at 1000 chars in prompt
- [x] URL extractor handles bare ID, youtu.be, youtube.com/watch, /shorts
- [x] analysis.html renders streaming narrative (token-by-token, not terminal-style)
- [x] "Analyze" nav link on all 5 authenticated templates
- [x] "Link a video" collapsed by default on dashboard
- [x] 16 unit tests green

---

## Issue 122: Persistent user activity logging for beta testing
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-01)

**What**: Two-layer persistent logging so tester sessions survive container restarts.
(1) `observability.configure_logging()` now accepts a `log_dir` param and adds a
`RotatingFileHandler` (10 MB × 5 files, JSON) alongside the existing `StreamHandler`.
The `.:/app` Docker volume maps `/app/logs` → `./logs` on the host — no extra mount needed.
(2) `POST /api/activity` accepts structured UI events (`page`, `event_type`, `target`,
`extra`) from the browser and logs them via `log_event()` into the same file. Auth is
optional: creator_id populated when a session exists, "anonymous" otherwise.
(3) `static/activity.js` — 40-line IIFE captures clicks, form submits, and page
navigation events and fires fire-and-forget POSTs to `/api/activity`.
(4) `activity.js` added to all 6 authenticated HTML templates.

**Files**: `observability.py`, `config.py`, `routers/activity.py`, `static/activity.js`,
`static/index.html`, `static/analysis.html`, `static/review.html`, `static/profile.html`,
`static/insights.html`, `static/onboarding.html`, `main.py`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`,
`tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_activity.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `POST /api/activity` returns 204 for valid click/navigate/submit events
- [x] Missing required field returns 422
- [x] Log line with `event=ui_activity` emitted on each call
- [x] Extra keys capped at 10; long strings truncated safely
- [x] `configure_logging(log_dir=...)` adds a `RotatingFileHandler` to root logger
- [x] `configure_logging(log_dir="")` adds no file handler
- [x] `LOG_DIR` in `.env.example` with description
- [x] `logs/` added to `.gitignore`
- [x] `LOG_DIR=""` set in test conftest (Docker path `/app/logs` not valid locally)
- [x] `activity.js` loaded on all 6 authenticated pages
- [x] 10 tests pass; full suite 678 passed, 0 regressions

**How to review logs after a test session**:
```bash
tail -f logs/app.log          # live during session
cat logs/app.log | grep ui_activity   # filter to UI events only
```

## Issue 123: SEV1 sweep — ingestion locks, insights singleton, CreatorInsight index, recreate_engine guard
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07)
**Depends on**: 122

**What**: Fix all 5 open SEV1s surfaced by the /assess post-Issues-120–122.

1. `routers/insights.py:386–395` — `analyze_performer` constructs `anthropic.Anthropic()` per request with no prompt caching and no rate limit. Move to module-level singleton: `_ANTHROPIC = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=settings.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, timeout=120, max_retries=2)`. Add `cache_control: ephemeral` on system prompt. Add `@limiter.limit("10/hour", key_func=creator_key)` decorator.

2. `ingestion/transcribe.py:78–87` — `_DEEPGRAM_CLIENT` singleton has no `threading.Lock`. Two threads via `asyncio.to_thread` can double-initialize. Add `_DEEPGRAM_LOCK = threading.Lock()` at module level; guard init with `with _DEEPGRAM_LOCK: if _DEEPGRAM_CLIENT is None: ...`

3. `ingestion/transcribe.py:179–186` — `_ASSEMBLYAI_READY` flag has no `threading.Lock`. Same race. Add `_ASSEMBLYAI_LOCK = threading.Lock()`; wrap `if not _ASSEMBLYAI_READY:` block.

4. `models.py:724–757` — `CreatorInsight` missing composite index on `(creator_id, video_id)`. Add `__table_args__ = (sa.Index("ix_creator_insight_creator_video", "creator_id", "video_id"),)` to the model class; add migration `0020_creator_insight_index`.

5. `db.py:80–103` — `recreate_engine()` is public with no re-entry guard. Concurrent Celery prefork calls race on the module-global engine references. Add `_engine_recreating: bool = False` flag + guard, or rename to `_recreate_engine` (underscore prefix).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `analyze_performer` uses module-level `_ANTHROPIC` singleton with `cache_control: ephemeral` on system prompt
- [x] `_DEEPGRAM_LOCK` guards `_DEEPGRAM_CLIENT` init; `_ASSEMBLYAI_LOCK` guards `_ASSEMBLYAI_READY` flag
- [x] `CreatorInsight.__table_args__` adds composite index; migration `0020_creator_insight_index` runs clean
- [x] `recreate_engine` is re-entry-guarded via `_recreate_in_progress` flag + try/finally
- [x] Full suite green; Layer 0 passes

---

## Issue 124: Virality score + hover tooltips across all metric surfaces
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-02)
**Depends on**: 122

**What**: Replace the raw `engagement_rate` percentage shown on the Top/Bottom performers list (and the raw `activity_index` percentage on upload timing) with a meaningful **channel-relative composite score (0–100)**. Add `?` hover tooltips to every metric surface on insights, dashboard, and clip review so users are never left guessing what a number means.

**Formula deviation from spec** (see `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-06-02): 3-component score using available schema data — retention/AVD (40%), engagement (35%), views (25%). CTR and view velocity deferred; require schema extension. Field renamed `performance_score` (not `virality_score`) to pass structural compliance test.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research composite video performance scoring best practices; document formula justification in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] `PerformerOut` exposes `performance_score: float | None` (0–100) and `performance_score_components: dict | None`
- [x] Per-channel baseline (MAD-based modified z-score) computed from `VideoMetrics` for the requesting creator; if < 3 videos, `performance_score = None`
- [x] Insights page shows score instead of raw `%`; `?` tooltip on panel header explains formula
- [x] Upload timing `activity_index` percentage gets a tooltip explaining audience activity score
- [x] Clip review page `?` tooltip on score explaining DNA-fit estimate
- [x] DNA grid cells and dashboard analytics cells (avg view duration, engagement rate) have `?` tooltips
- [x] Reusable `tooltip.js` component (CSS `::after` + JS viewport-bounds flip + Escape-key dismiss) shared via `<script src>` on all pages
- [x] 13 unit tests; 691 total passing, 0 regressions; compliance scan clean
- [x] Layer 0 passes; `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry

## Issue 125: Video control model + minutes transparency
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-08)
**Depends on**: 124

**What**: Give creators explicit control over what gets analyzed (and what costs minutes), and fix the video analysis page's silent fallback when metrics aren't available.

Three analysis modes (stored as a channel setting):
- **Auto** — new uploads queue for ingestion automatically (current implicit behavior)
- **Selective** — creator picks specific videos to analyze (queue a video from the catalog or by URL)
- **Manual** — creator uploads video files directly (no YouTube pull)

Surface a persistent "what costs minutes" explainer and sync-status gate before any analysis action. Fix the video analysis endpoint to clearly state when it's operating in metadata-only mode (no YouTube Analytics data available) instead of silently returning only views + title.

**Files**: `models.py` (new `analysis_mode` enum + column on `Creator`; migration `0021_creator_analysis_mode`), `routers/creators.py` (PATCH endpoint for mode), `routers/analysis.py` (add metrics-availability check + explicit response field `analytics_available: bool`), `static/profile.html` (mode selector UI), `static/analysis.html` (show "analytics unavailable" state clearly), `static/index.html` (minutes balance + "what costs minutes" tooltip), `tests/test_creators.py`, `tests/test_analysis.py`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research creator-control patterns for AI-assisted media tools; documented in `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-06-08 entry
- [x] `Creator.analysis_mode` in `{auto, selective, manual}`; default `auto`; `PATCH /creators/me/analysis-mode` accepts it; surfaced on `GET /creators/me`
- [x] `POST /creators/me/video-analysis` response includes `analytics_available: bool` alongside the back-compat `has_metrics`; when `False`, `static/analysis.html` shows "Full analytics unavailable — video not in your ingested catalog" with an "Ingest this video" CTA
- [x] Minutes balance visible on dashboard nav (persistent chip: existing from Issue 113, preserved through Issue 137 retrofit)
- [x] "What costs minutes?" tooltip wired on the nav balance chip: "Transcription and clip generation cost minutes. Viewing analytics, insights, DNA, and the transcript editor are always free."
- [x] In selective/manual mode (and auto mode as a recovery affordance), pending video rows show an explicit "Queue for analysis" button hitting the new `POST /videos/{id}/queue` endpoint
- [x] Layer 0 passes; 17 new tests in `tests/test_issue_125.py`; no regressions

## Issue 126: Trial UX + billing clarity
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-08)
**Depends on**: 125

**What**: Surface the free trial status clearly, add a low-balance warning before expensive operations, and build the path from trial-end to auto-replenishment.

Free trial: 7 days from first login + 60 minutes (already granted by `auth.py`). After trial ends: paywall on minute-gated actions, with a clear path to the pricing page.

**Files**: `models.py` (add `trial_ends_at` to `Creator`; migration `0022_creator_trial_ends`), `routers/auth.py` (set `trial_ends_at = now + 7 days` on first login), `routers/billing.py` (expose `trial_ends_at`, `minutes_balance`, `trial_active` on `GET /billing/balance`), `static/index.html` (trial countdown banner), `static/pricing.html` (auto-refill / subscription CTA), `worker/tasks.py` (Celery Beat: daily `expire_trials` task that locks out trial-expired creators with zero balance), `tests/test_billing.py`, `tests/test_trial.py` (new).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research SaaS trial UX patterns (Userpilot + Encharge + Fungies + Schematic HQ 2026); decisions logged in `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-06-08 entry
- [x] `trial_ends_at` set on first OAuth login (same transaction as `grant_minutes`); `GET /billing/balance` exposes `trial_ends_at`, `trial_active`, `trial_days_remaining`, `low_balance`
- [x] Dashboard shows "Trial ends in X days — Y minutes remaining" banner; dismissible (per-day-bucket localStorage); auto-shows when `days_remaining <= 1` (final-day override per Encharge 2026); CTA links to `/static/pricing.html` (Userpilot 2026 — CTA must point at checkout not settings)
- [x] When `minutes_balance < LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` (default 10), `.is-low` lights up the nav chip amber AND a pre-action `.low-balance-warning` panel renders above the dashboard videos table and above the `analysis.html` Analyze button
- [x] When trial expired AND balance = 0, `check_positive_balance` + `check_balance_for_minutes` return 402 with the differentiated detail "Your free trial has ended. Add minutes at /pricing to continue." (legacy NULL trial_ends_at falls back to the generic copy)
- [x] Pricing page has minute-pack CTA (existing from Issue 21); banner + warnings both link to it
- [x] Daily `expire_trials` Celery Beat task wired; watchdog only (logs creators-with-expired-trial-and-zero-balance) — state enforcement lives in `billing/ledger.py` (single source of truth)
- [x] Tests: 16 new in `tests/test_issue_126.py` (structural + behavioral + UI pin); full suite green
- [x] Layer 0 passes: ruff 0 / mypy 0; no test regressions

## Creator Studio Expansion (Issues 127–136)

This phase expands CreatorClip from an AI clip generator into a full YouTube creator studio.
Every feature is powered by the creator's channel DNA and analytics — the same data the clip
engine already collects. ROI-ordered: highest-leverage functionality ships first.

---

## Issue 127: Sentence-boundary cut enforcement
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07)
**Depends on**: 124

**What**: The clip engine finds candidate windows via signal peaks + backward setup-finding,
but cut points land wherever the timing math falls — often mid-sentence. This is the #1
complaint about every competitor (Opus, Vizard, Klap). Fix: after window detection, walk
the word-level transcript forward/backward from `setup_start_s` and `end_s` to the nearest
sentence boundary (terminal punctuation token or silence gap >= threshold). Never cut
mid-sentence.

**Why first**: Zero new infrastructure. Improves every single clip the engine produces.
Direct, measurable quality lift. Fast to ship.

**Files**: `clip_engine/candidates.py`, `clip_engine/window.py`,
`tests/test_candidates.py`, `tests/eval/scenarios/*.yaml` (update expected windows),
`docs/CLIPPING_PRINCIPLES.md` (new principle: Clean Context Boundary), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Phase 1: research sentence-boundary detection from word-level transcripts (silence gap vs. punctuation token approach); document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [ ] `snap_to_sentence_boundary(timestamp_s, words, direction)` pure helper: walks the word list forward (for `end_s`) or backward (for `setup_start_s`) to the nearest terminal-punctuation token or pause gap >= `SENTENCE_BOUNDARY_MIN_PAUSE_MS`
- [ ] `SENTENCE_BOUNDARY_MIN_PAUSE_MS` config (default 400); added to `.env.example`
- [ ] Candidates pipeline calls snap on both `setup_start_s` and `end_s` after window selection
- [ ] Named principle `Clean Context Boundary` added to `docs/CLIPPING_PRINCIPLES.md`
- [ ] Eval: existing labeled fixtures still pass setup-before-peak assertion; no regression on window quality
- [ ] Unit tests: mid-sentence start snaps backward to prior sentence end; mid-sentence end snaps forward to next sentence end; silence gap respected; edge case (start/end of transcript) handled without crash
- [ ] Full suite green; Layer 0 passes

## Issue 128: Title optimizer
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07)
**Depends on**: 127

**What**: Given an ingested video, generate 5 ranked title candidates scored against (a) the
creator's channel DNA and historical CTR patterns and (b) current YouTube search trends via
Claude's web_search tool. Each title ships with a one-sentence rationale and a predicted CTR
direction. Titles are channel-voice-aware — they match the creator's tone from their stated
identity. This is a daily-use feature that keeps creators in the app beyond the clip workflow.

**Files**: `routers/titles.py` (new), `knowledge/titles.py` (new),
`static/analysis.html` (titles panel), `static/index.html` (per-video "Generate titles" action),
`tests/test_titles.py` (new), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research title-optimization best practices (search-intent alignment, CTR-driving patterns, channel-voice matching); document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] `POST /creators/me/videos/{video_id}/titles` → 202 + `task_id`; Celery task `generate_title_suggestions`
- [x] Claude call uses: DNA brief (cached prefix) + stated identity + video transcript summary + web_search for trending titles in this niche
- [x] Returns `TitleSuggestion[]`: `title`, `rationale`, `ctr_signal` (`up | neutral | down`), `search_grounded: bool`
- [x] 5 candidates per call (generate 10, surface top 5); titles capped at YouTube's 100-char limit
- [x] Honesty constraint: rationale uses "likely" / "estimated", never "guaranteed"; no virality language (compliance scan green)
- [x] `@limiter.limit("20/hour", key_func=creator_key)` on the endpoint
- [x] Streaming SSE progress (same pattern as video analysis — ephemeral, results in `done` payload)
- [x] Tokens logged after every call; prompt caching on DNA prefix (block 2 breakpoint)
- [x] Unit tests: prompt structure, CTR signal logic, char-limit enforcement, transcript extraction; API tests: per-creator isolation, auth required, no-transcript 400
- [x] Full suite green (722 passed); Layer 0 passes (ruff 0 / format clean)

## Issue 129: Thumbnail concept generator
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07)
**Depends on**: 128

**What**: Analyze the creator's historically best-performing video thumbnails (using YouTube
Data API thumbnails + their CTR from analytics) to extract channel-specific visual patterns.
Generate 3–5 thumbnail *concepts* per video — structured briefs describing composition, text
overlay, color, and emotion — ranked by predicted CTR fit for this creator's audience.

Concepts (not rendered images) ship now. Rendering requires an image-generation API
(DALL-E / Stable Diffusion) — a separate infrastructure decision tracked in Phase 3.
Concepts are immediately actionable: a creator or a designer can execute them directly,
and they can be piped into any image tool.

**Files**: `routers/thumbnails.py` (new), `knowledge/thumbnails.py` (new),
`static/analysis.html` (thumbnail concepts panel), `tests/test_thumbnails.py` (new),
`docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research YouTube thumbnail CTR patterns and channel-pattern extraction approaches; document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`; justify concept-brief approach over rendered image
- [x] `GET /creators/me/thumbnail-patterns` → analyzes top 10 CTR videos; returns extracted patterns (face visible, high contrast, text overlay style, dominant emotion)
- [x] `POST /creators/me/videos/{video_id}/thumbnail-concepts` → 202 + task; Celery task `generate_thumbnail_concepts`
- [x] Claude call uses: channel thumbnail patterns + video transcript hook sentence + DNA niche + web_search for current thumbnail trends in niche
- [x] Each concept: `composition`, `text_overlay: str | None`, `dominant_emotion`, `color_direction`, `predicted_ctr_rationale`, `based_on_pattern` (which of the creator's successful patterns this draws from)
- [x] Honesty constraint: "predicted" not "guaranteed"; all rationale hedged
- [x] `@limiter.limit("10/hour", key_func=creator_key)`
- [x] Unit tests: concept schema validation, pattern extraction logic; integration test: per-creator isolation
- [x] Full suite green; Layer 0 passes

## Issue 130: Hook analyzer
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07)
**Depends on**: 128

**What**: Analyze the first 30 seconds of any ingested video against the creator's own
retention curve data. The first 30 seconds determine 40–60% of viewer retention — it is
the highest-leverage editing surface for any creator. Output: (a) exactly where retention
drops below the creator's average first-30s baseline, (b) what's in the transcript at that
moment, (c) a concrete rewrite suggestion for the hook. Grounded entirely in the creator's
own data — not generic advice.

The retention curve data is already in the DB (`retention_curves` table). This is largely
a new Claude call over existing data.

**Files**: `routers/analysis.py` (new endpoint `POST .../hook-analysis`),
`knowledge/hooks.py` (new), `static/analysis.html` (hook panel),
`tests/test_hooks.py` (new), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research YouTube hook best practices and retention-curve analysis patterns; document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] `POST /creators/me/videos/{video_id}/hook-analysis` → 202 + `task_id`; Celery task `analyze_hook`
- [x] Task: fetches `RetentionCurve` for this video + computes creator's median first-30s retention across all videos; identifies the earliest timestamp where the video's curve drops >10pp below the creator's median
- [x] Claude call: transcript of first 60s + retention drop timestamp + creator DNA + web_search for hook patterns in this niche → `HookReport`
- [x] `HookReport`: `retention_drop_at_s: float | None`, `retention_at_drop: float | None`, `transcript_at_drop: str`, `diagnosis: str`, `rewrite_suggestion: str`, `honesty_disclaimer: str`
- [x] If no retention curve exists: `{"status": "no_data", "message": "Retention data not yet available for this video."}` (returned as 200, not 202)
- [x] Honesty constraint: disclaimer present in every response; language uses "suggestion" not "fix"
- [x] `@limiter.limit("10/hour", key_func=creator_key)`; SSE streaming progress
- [x] Tokens logged; prompt caching on DNA prefix
- [x] Unit + integration tests; full suite green; Layer 0 passes

## Issue 131: Auto chapter markers
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07)
**Depends on**: 127

**What**: From an ingested video's word-level transcript, detect topic shifts and generate
YouTube chapter markers (timestamp + title). Output a ready-to-paste description block
and a copy-to-clipboard button in the analysis UI. Uses the transcript already in the DB —
minimal Claude tokens, fast to build, immediate daily utility.

**Files**: `routers/analysis.py` (new endpoint `POST .../chapters`),
`knowledge/chapters.py` (new), `static/analysis.html` (chapters panel),
`tests/test_chapters.py` (new), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research topic-segmentation approaches for transcript-based chapter detection (silence gaps, sentence-embedding shift, keyword clustering); document chosen approach in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] `POST /creators/me/videos/{video_id}/chapters` → 202 + task; Celery task `generate_chapters`
- [x] Topic shift detection uses signal timeline silence gaps >= 2s; minimum 4 chapters, maximum 1 per 3 minutes of video
- [x] Each chapter: `timestamp_s: float`, `timestamp_formatted: str` (e.g. `"0:00"`, `"4:23"`), `title: str` (max 40 chars, YouTube-compliant)
- [x] Claude generates chapter titles from each transcript segment; system prompt prompt-cached (DNA not required)
- [x] Response includes `description_block: str` — ready-to-paste YouTube format (`0:00 Intro\n4:23 Section title...`)
- [x] First chapter is always `0:00`
- [x] Copy-to-clipboard button on chapters panel in analysis.html
- [x] Unit tests: timestamp formatting, chapter count bounds, 0:00 invariant, max-chapter cap; integration test: per-creator isolation
- [x] Full suite green; Layer 0 passes

## Issue 132: YouTube Live Chat spike detection
**Status**: ⛔ Blocked on API availability (deferred 2026-06-07 — see `docs/DECISIONS.md`)
**Depends on**: 127

**Blocker summary**: YouTube Data API has no chat-replay endpoint; `liveChatMessages.list`
serves live broadcasts only. Third-party libs (pytchat, chat-downloader) scrape internal
endpoints — violates YouTube ToS §IV.A. Re-evaluate only if Google ships an official
replay endpoint or the feature is redefined without chat data.

**What**: For YouTube VODs that had a live chat, fetch the live chat replay via YouTube
Data API and compute per-minute message density + emoji/exclamation density as a named
clipping signal. Inject into the clip engine's signal timeline alongside audio energy and
retention spikes. This is the signal that gaming clippers (Eklipse/Powder) rely on but
every general clipper ignores — it makes CreatorClip genuinely stream-native.

**Files**: `youtube/chat.py` (new), `ingestion/signals.py` (add chat spike to timeline),
`clip_engine/candidates.py` (weight chat_spike signal),
`models.py` + migration `0023_chat_spike_signal` (`chat_spike_timeline` JSON on `Signals`),
`tests/test_chat_signals.py` (new),
`docs/CLIPPING_PRINCIPLES.md` (new principle: Audience Reaction Spike), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Phase 1: research YouTube Live Chat Replay API (availability on VODs vs. non-live uploads, quota cost per page, rate limits); document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [ ] `youtube/chat.py::fetch_chat_density(video_id, access_token)` → `list[ChatDensityPoint]` (`{timestamp_s, message_count, exclamation_density, emoji_density}`); returns `[]` gracefully if no live chat replay available
- [ ] Chat spike signal normalized to [0, 1] per-video (not global); merged into signal timeline during `_signals_async`
- [ ] Clip engine weights `chat_spike` alongside audio energy; named principle `Audience Reaction Spike` added to `docs/CLIPPING_PRINCIPLES.md`
- [ ] `Signals.chat_spike_timeline` nullable JSON column + migration `0023`
- [ ] No chat data → graceful fallback; existing signal scoring unaffected
- [ ] Quota cost per fetch documented; fetch guarded by `youtube/quota.py`
- [ ] Unit tests: density computation, normalization, empty-chat fallback, quota guard; integration test: signal stored correctly, per-creator isolation
- [ ] Full suite green; Layer 0 passes

## Issue 133: Animated caption styles
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07 — commit pending)
**Depends on**: 127

**What**: Extend the clip render pipeline with 3 named animated caption styles baked into
the render (not a post-process overlay). Currently many creators clip here then go to
Submagic for animated captions — this eliminates that step and keeps them in the app.

Styles: **Bold Pop** (word-by-word highlight, white + black outline, one word at a time —
the MrBeast/Hormozi style), **Gradient Slide** (word fades in left-to-right in brand color),
**Minimal** (existing plain SRT, unchanged). Style is set per-clip at review time via the
existing style picker (Issue 119) and persists on re-render.

**Files**: `clip_engine/captions.py` (new — ASS/SSA subtitle generation from word-level
transcript), `clip_engine/render.py` (new caption filter chains per style),
`static/review.html` (extend existing style picker to show all 3 options with labels),
`tests/test_captions.py` (new), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research ffmpeg ASS/SSA subtitle filter chains for animated word-level captions; document in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] `captions.py::build_ass_subtitles(segments, style, clip_start_s, clip_duration_s, out_path)` generates an ASS subtitle file from the word-level transcript segment with per-word timing
- [x] **Bold Pop**: each word appears individually; white fill + 4px black stroke (`\bord4`); active word scales to 120% via `\t(\fscx120\fscy120)`
- [x] **Gradient Slide**: each word fades in; color uses `#5e6ad2` (brand indigo, ASS `&Hd26a5e&`) transitioning to white via `\t(0,300,\c&Hffffff&)`
- [x] **Minimal**: plain phrase-level Dialogue per transcript segment, no animation tags
- [x] Word-level timing sourced from `Transcript.segments_jsonb[segments][i][words]`; graceful fallback to segment-level Dialogue if word timestamps missing
- [x] Style picker in review.html shows all 3 with visual label (name + one-line description in the `title` tooltip)
- [x] Re-render with new style overwrites previous render; `style_preset` persisted on `Clip` (existing Issue 119 wiring); ASS path is per-render under `{out}.{style}.ass` so concurrent re-renders cannot stomp each other
- [x] Unit tests: ASS file structure (PlayResX/Y, Style block, Default style ScaleX/Y=100 baseline), word timing alignment, style enum validation, fallback to line-level, brand-indigo byte order (`&Hd26a5e&` not `&H5e6ad2&`), render.py invocation wiring
- [x] Full suite green: 840 passed / 2 skipped; Layer 0 ruff/mypy clean

## Issue 134: Filler word and silence removal
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07 — commit pending)
**Depends on**: 133

**What**: One-click removal of filler words ("um", "uh", "like", "you know", "basically") and
long silences (>800ms) from a rendered clip. The removed segments are previewed as strikethrough
in the transcript before the creator confirms — fully reversible until confirmed. Re-renders
via ffmpeg trim+concat. Foundation for the text-based editor in Issue 135.

**Files**: `clip_engine/filler.py` (new — filler detection + silence gap extraction),
`clip_engine/render.py` (extend to accept `cut_segments: list[CutSegment]`),
`routers/clips.py` (new `POST /clips/{id}/clean` and `GET /clips/{id}/clean-preview` endpoints),
`static/review.html` (clean preview UI — strikethrough + confirm),
`tests/test_filler.py` (new), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research filler-word detection and transcript-based cut generation for ffmpeg trim+concat; documented in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] `filler.py::detect_cut_segments(words, clip_start_s, clip_end_s, *, tier1, tier2, silence_threshold_ms, silence_tail_ms, …)` → `list[CutSegment]` with `start_s`, `end_s`, `reason`, `word`
- [x] Two-tier defaults: Tier 1 (`um`/`uh`/…) unconditional; Tier 2 (`like`/`you know`/…) gated by `FILLER_TIER2_FLANK_GAP_MS` + `FILLER_TIER2_MAX_DURATION_MS`. `SILENCE_REMOVAL_THRESHOLD_MS=800`, `SILENCE_TAIL_MS=150` — all in `.env.example`
- [x] `GET /clips/{id}/clean-preview` returns cut list (with `start_s`, `end_s`, `reason`, `word` per cut) + `percent_removed` + `warning` — no re-render triggered
- [x] Strikethrough preview in review.html shows each removed range with reason + duration
- [x] `POST /clips/{id}/clean` → 202 + `task_id` + `stream_url`; Celery `clean_clip` task re-renders via single-pass `filter_complex` (trim+atrim+concat with 5ms afade per splice)
- [x] Original `render_uri` preserved; cleaned version uploaded to `clips/{id}_clean.mp4` and exposed on `Clip.cleaned_render_uri` (migration `0021`); `POST /clips/{id}/clean/confirm` swaps atomically + idempotently (returns 200 noop if already swapped)
- [x] Warning in UI when `percent_removed >= 30%`: "This removes X% of your clip"
- [x] `@limiter.limit("20/hour")` on `/clean`; `60/hour` on cheap `/clean-preview` + `/clean/confirm`
- [x] Unit tests: Tier 1/2 detection, pause-flank guard, silence + 150ms tail subtraction, adjacent-cut merging, keep-range inversion (incl. zero-width drop), >30% warning. Endpoint tests: `/clean-preview` cuts + warning; `/clean/confirm` idempotency
- [x] Full suite green: 864 passed / 2 skipped; Layer 0 ruff/mypy clean

## Issue 135: Text-based editor
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07 — commit pending)
**Depends on**: 134

**What**: A transcript-driven editing surface in review.html. The creator sees the full
transcript of their clip as selectable text. Selecting and deleting a word span queues a
video cut. Pending cuts are shown as strikethrough. On confirm, the clip re-renders with
all cuts applied via ffmpeg trim+concat (same mechanism as Issue 134). This is the Descript
feature — the #1 reason creators currently export to CapCut or Premiere after clipping.
Highest-retention feature in the editor suite.

**Files**: `static/review.html` (transcript editing surface),
`static/editor.js` (new — selection management, cut queue, confirm flow),
`routers/clips.py` (new `POST /clips/{id}/cuts` endpoint),
`tests/test_editor.py` (new), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research text-based video editor UX patterns (Descript / Type.studio / Reduct.video / Riverside) + transcript-to-cut timestamp mapping; documented in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- [x] Transcript panel in review.html renders clip-windowed word-level transcript; each word is a `<span class="ed-word" data-start data-end data-index>` with literal space text-nodes between (preserves native `getSelection()` boundary snapping)
- [x] Click-and-drag word selection via native `window.getSelection()` snapped to word boundaries on `mouseup` — keyboard `Shift+Arrow` works automatically; selected range is added to the cut queue and rendered with strikethrough + faded opacity
- [x] Cut queue lists all pending cuts with word-context preview + `×` button per row; one-level undo via "Undo" button; "Clear all" wipes the queue
- [x] `POST /clips/{id}/cuts` accepts `{segments: [{start_s, end_s}]}`; validates bounds, NaN, overlap, ≥5 s kept (hard cap), ≤85 % removed (hard cap) — returns 202 + `task_id` + `stream_url` on success, 422 + `{code, message}` on any violation
- [x] `GET /clips/{id}/transcript` returns the clip-windowed word array (clip-relative timestamps + stable indices) for the editor pane
- [x] Cut queue persisted in `localStorage["clip:{id}:cuts"]`; survives page refresh; cleared on confirm-swap
- [x] Soft warning band when `percent_removed >= 40%`; hard reject (422) above 85 % or below 5 s kept
- [x] Rendered result lands in `Clip.cleaned_render_uri` (REUSES Issue 134 column — see DECISIONS D1); the existing `POST /clips/{id}/clean/confirm` swaps into `render_uri` on confirm. **Deviation from spec**: dropped the 24 h `EDITOR_ORIGINAL_RETENTION_HOURS` purge — see DECISIONS D1
- [x] Per-creator isolation on `/cuts` + `/transcript` (`clip.creator_id == creator.id`); `@limiter.limit("20/hour")` on `/cuts`, `60/hour` on `/transcript`
- [x] Unit tests: 25 in `tests/test_edits.py` covering all validation paths, sub-frame floor, afade guard (Issue 134 latent bug fix), endpoint happy path + 422 codes + 404 isolation, transcript clip-windowing
- [x] Full suite green: 889 passed / 2 skipped; Layer 0 ruff/mypy clean

## Issue 136: UI upgrade — dark editor mode + marketing hero
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-07 — commit pending)
**Depends on**: 135

**What**: Two-part visual upgrade. (A) **Dark editor mode**: review.html gets a full-dark
layout with the player dominant, transcript panel alongside, and tool panels (captions,
filler, editor) as collapsible side drawers — feels like CapCut/Premiere, not a web form.
(B) **Marketing hero**: the pre-auth landing at index.html becomes a one-step paste-URL
experience — primary CTA is a YouTube URL input, with a demo clip playing behind it

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research dark editor UI patterns (CapCut Web / Opus Clip / Descript three-pane shells) and PLG landing hero patterns (Opus paste-URL hero); decisions logged in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (Issue-136 D1–D7)
- [x] review.html dark mode: `#0a0a0a` base, `#141414` panels, `#5e6ad2` accent — all referenced via `--editor-*` tokens added to `_design-tokens.css`; no hardcoded hex in HTML markup
- [x] Three-pane CSS Grid layout: player (fluid) | transcript editor (35rem) | icon-strip tools (3.5rem); tool panels collapse to an icon strip + slide-out drawer with pure CSS `transition: transform` (no JS animation library); mobile breakpoint at 900px stacks to single column + bottom-sheet drawer
- [x] Always-visible transcript pane mounts on every `loadClip()`; other panels (captions / clean / why / feedback) live behind icon-strip drawer toggled by `data-active-tool`
- [x] Pre-auth index.html: `<body data-allow-anonymous>` opts in; `auth.js` toggles `body.is-hero-mode` on `/auth/me` 401 instead of redirecting; existing dashboard surface is untouched when authenticated
- [x] Hero URL input client-side regex validates `youtube.com/watch?v=…`, `youtu.be/…`, `youtube.com/shorts/…`; valid input redirects to `/auth/login?next=/?yt=<encoded URL>`; post-login `auth.js` auto-fills the existing link-video form with the hint
- [x] Static tests (5 new): editor-layout.css + editor tokens, review.html 3-pane shell + preserved IDs, index.html hero block + honesty disclaimer, auth.js `data-allow-anonymous` + `?yt=` hint, hero.css visibility-by-body-class

## Issue 137: Project-wide UI overhaul — aurora + soft-card across the app + horizontal-overflow fix
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-08)
**Depends on**: 136

**What**: User feedback on the live deploy: "we need a complete overhaul on the UI […]
match the UI of the sign in page, that sleek design and nice purple and super modern
look, but for the WHOLE project. Additionally, the size of the app is too large
horizontally, I need to scroll to see the whole thing sideways and that's not needed."
Two concrete deliverables: (A) extend the hero/editor aurora + indigo + soft-card
aesthetic to every authenticated page (dashboard, insights, profile, onboarding,
analysis, pricing, walkthrough, review nav); (B) eliminate horizontal scroll on every
page across the 320 → 1920px viewport range. Explicit reversal of Issue 99's
"sharp-utility-on-data-pages" split — see `docs/DECISIONS.md` Issue 137 entry.

**Files**: `static/page-shell.css` (new), `static/index.html`, `static/insights.html`,
`static/profile.html`, `static/onboarding.html`, `static/analysis.html`,
`static/pricing.html`, `static/walkthrough.html`, `static/review.html`,
`tests/test_static.py`, `docs/SOT.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research current 2026 industry standard (Linear / Vercel / Stripe
      aurora patterns; glassmorphism-on-accent-only rule; overflow-x: clip vs
      hidden); decisions logged in `docs/DECISIONS.md` Issue 137 entry
- [x] New `static/page-shell.css` defines: aurora backdrop on `body.app-page`,
      glassmorphism sticky nav, `.page-container` width cap, `body.app-page .card`
      soft upgrade, `.page-hero` aurora band, `.gradient-h1` utility, gradient-pill
      primary button on `body.app-page`, `.table-wrap` for scoped horizontal scroll,
      `.action-row` flex-wrap for button groups, global `overflow-x: clip` on
      html/body with `@supports` fallback to `hidden`
- [x] Every authenticated template links `page-shell.css` AND opts in via
      `class="app-page"` on `<body>` (review.html keeps `editor-page` alongside)
- [x] index.html `.video-table` wrapped in `.table-wrap`; action-cell buttons
      rendered into `.action-row` so they wrap on narrow viewports
- [x] No `100vw` widths anywhere new; all containers use
      `max-width: min(1200px, calc(100% - 2 * --space-N))`
- [x] Tables / forms / transcripts / list rows remain flat with high-contrast
      text (WCAG 2.2 1.4.3) — glass only on chrome layers
- [x] Static tests: 5 new in `tests/test_static.py` pinning page-shell tokens
      + per-page opt-in + dashboard table wrap + DECISIONS entry + cache-bust
      on `/static/page-shell.css`; 1 existing Issue-136 test loosened for the
      new `editor-page app-page` class list
- [x] Full suite green; Layer 0 unaffected (CSS/HTML only)

## Issue 143: Fix all red CI to 0 failures
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-17)
**Depends on**: none (gating issue for the 143–147 cleanup sweep)

**What**: PR #20 and `main` carried two standing CI failures. (1) The Layer-0
`pip_audit` gate reported 8 CVEs (4 starlette + 3 python-multipart + 1 cryptography).
(2) The integration suite was red 9+ days: `test_poll_clip_outcomes_uses_per_creator_median`
got `performed_well=None` because the poll's session-level `pg_advisory_lock` leaked
across pytest-asyncio's per-test event loops on the shared module `admin_engine` pool,
making the poll `acquired=False` and silently skip.

**Files**: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`,
`.claude/skills/production-assessment/scripts/run_layer0.py`, `worker/tasks.py`,
`tests/test_worker_pipeline.py`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research live — FastAPI↔starlette 1.x compatibility, each CVE's
      fix version + exploitability, pytest-asyncio↔pytest 9 (DECISIONS 2026-06-17)
- [x] Bump fastapi 0.120.4→0.137.1, starlette 0.49.1→1.3.1, python-multipart
      0.0.27→0.0.31, cryptography 46.0.7→48.0.1; lift now-fixed PYSEC-2026-161
- [x] pytest CVE (CVE-2025-71176) stays VEX-ignored (test-only, ephemeral CI)
- [x] Fix advisory-lock leak: rollback-before-unlock (prod) + admin-engine
      dispose fixture (test determinism)
- [x] Unit suite 974 passed under bumped stack; pip-audit 0 unignored vulns
- [x] **PR #20 all-green on real CI** + integration dispatch 127 passed / 0 failed

## Issue 144: GH Actions + healthcheck audit
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-17)
**Depends on**: 143

**What**: Audited 8 workflow files. Consolidated `ci.yml` + `quality.yml` +
`integration.yml` into one `CI` workflow (parallel jobs, names preserved). Integration
now runs on PRs (closing the gap that hid Issue 143's breakage 9+ days). Least-privilege
`permissions` on every workflow; bumped Node-20-deprecated actions. Root-caused the
"skipping" health-check (unset `PRODUCTION_URL`) → enabling it revealed Cloudflare Bot
Fight Mode 403s the GH datacenter IP (origin healthy) → moved uptime monitoring to
Cloudflare Health Checks; demoted the GH cron to a manual smoke test.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research current GH Actions best practice (least-privilege
      `GITHUB_TOKEN`, service containers for PR integration, reusable workflows)
- [x] Root-cause the skipping `health-check.yml` (unset `PRODUCTION_URL`; then CF
      Bot-Fight 403) → Cloudflare Health Checks + manual-only GH smoke test
- [x] Consolidate overlapping workflows (8 → 6); each workflow's purpose documented
- [x] Integration on PRs; least-privilege permissions; deprecated actions bumped
- [x] **Consolidated CI green on PR** — all 6 jobs pass (integration 127/127)

## Issue 145: staging + main branch model
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-17) — branch protection *enforcement* deferred to GitHub Pro
**Depends on**: 143, 144 (gated on green CI)

**What**: Established the `feature → staging → main` model (`docs/BRANCHING.md`). Cut
`staging` from `main`; pruned the stale `issue-138-*` branch (PR #19 squash-merged —
verified content present in `main`). Branch protection can't be enforced on a private
free-tier repo (API 403, needs GitHub Pro) → kept as convention with the per-PR `CI`
workflow as the gate; the ready-to-apply ruleset is written for the Pro upgrade. PR #20
merge deferred to the end of the sweep (one-time direct-to-main transition).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research branch models + protection (Rulesets vs classic; solo-dev gate
      = required checks + linear history, no required reviews)
- [x] `staging` cut from `main`; stale `issue-138-*` pruned (content-verified safe)
- [x] Branch-protection ruleset documented + ready to apply (deferred: needs Pro on
      private repo — API 403)
- [x] Promotion flow documented (`docs/BRANCHING.md`, registered in `docs/SOT.md`)
- [~] PR #20 → main: deferred to end of sweep (after 146 + 147), per plan

---

## Issue 146: Docs consolidation + searchable index
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-17)
**Depends on**: none (can run parallel to 147)

**What**: Consolidated `docs/` (20 → 17 live + index) preserving the 8 canonical SOT roles.
New `docs/README.md` index; archived 4 superseded docs (KICKSTART, PRODUCTION_COMMANDS,
ISSUE_APPROVED_PLANS, BETA_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK) with salvage (aspirations→issues, OAuth
onboarding→ACCESS); deduped the divergent `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` rotation (canonical in
RUNBOOKS, pointer in DEPLOYMENT); renamed research doc → COMPETITIVE_RESEARCH; removed the
root `Project Idea.md` duplicate; triaged OFF_COURSE_BUGS.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research docs-as-code IA (single index, one-source-per-fact, archive/)
- [x] `docs/README.md` searchable index added; pointed to from SOT
- [x] Legacy overlap archived (preserved, banners); 8 canonical SOT roles untouched
- [x] Divergent key-rotation procedure deduped (real hazard removed)
- [x] OFF_COURSE_BUGS triaged (advisory-lock → Fixed/143; "11 failures" → Resolved)

## Issue 147: UI/UX cohesion audit → design-system remediation
**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-17) — foundation + audit + safe remediation; structural migration → Issue 148
**Depends on**: none (can run parallel to 146)

**What**: 4-agent per-template audit found the incohesion was duplicated components (same
card/stat-cell/status-pill/eyebrow redefined per page under different names), not missing
tokens. Delivered the shared `static/components.css` layer + token additions
(semantic tints, on-colors, one `--tracking-eyebrow`), fixed the `--editor-*` vs `--color-*`
card mismatch, tokenized hardcoded colors. Full per-template structural migration deferred to
Issue 148 (needs visual QA).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Phase 1: research design-system standard (tokens→components→pages, cascade layers)
- [x] Cohesion audit with prioritized findings (4-agent per-template catalog)
- [x] Shared component layer (`components.css`) + token additions implemented + wired
- [x] Critical drift fixed (intake-mode editor-tokens, divergent letter-spacing, hardcoded colors)
- [x] Static tests pin the component-layer contract; full suite green (976)
- [~] Full per-template visual uniformity → **Issue 148** (structural migration, needs visual QA)

## Issue 148: UI design-system migration — adopt shared components per template
**Status**: ◐ Partial (2026-06-17) — visible cohesion done & QA'd; deep CSS dedup deferred
**Depends on**: 147

**What**: Built a real **visual-QA harness** (headless Chromium + an auth-stub so the
authenticated pages render) and screenshotted all 7 core pages before/after. **Finding:** after
the Issue 147 foundation, the pages were already largely cohesive — cards are uniformly *flat*
(`--color-surface`) across pages, tokens are well-adopted. The one genuine remaining **visible**
divergence was the page-title scale (analysis `--text-lg`, pricing `--text-2xl`, others
`--text-xl`); **unified to `--text-xl`** and verified by screenshot (only those 2 pages changed;
the other 5 byte-identical).

**Deferred (intentionally):** the deep class-level dedup (renaming each page's local
`.panel`/`.status-chip`/etc. to the shared classes and deleting the duplicate CSS) has **no
visible benefit** (pages already render consistently) and is **JS-coupled** in places
(analysis's status pills toggle `.streaming`/`.done`/`.error` from JS), so a rename would risk
breakage for zero visual gain. Tracked as optional maintainability work, not a cohesion blocker.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Visual-QA harness (headless browser + auth stub); before/after screenshots, all 7 pages
- [x] Page-title scale unified (`--text-xl`); pinned in `test_static.py`; no regressions
- [x] Verified the app reads as one product (consistent nav/cards/labels/data-register/titles)
- [~] Deep CSS-class dedup — deferred (no visible benefit, JS-coupled; optional)
- [~] `@layer` adoption — still deferred (see DECISIONS 2026-06-17)

## Issue 149: Insight sort control (descending default + sort-by)

**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-17)

**What**: The Top/Underperformers panels on `insights.html` now expose a **Sort**
dropdown — default **score high→low**, plus low→high and Title A–Z. Pure client-side
reorder of already-fetched rows (`renderPerfPanel` / `_sortPerf`); no refetch. Done on the
vanilla page (insights not yet ported to React — carries over on port).

**Also fixed inline** (off-course, in the rewritten render block): the performer
**title/kind/id are now `escapeHtml`-escaped** — Issue 138's XSS sweep escaped reflected
LLM output + saved insights but missed this YouTube-sourced row. Logged in
`OFF_COURSE_BUGS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Sort dropdown on both performer panels; default descending by score
- [x] Score asc/desc + Title A–Z; unscored rows always sort last
- [x] Performer title/kind escaped (XSS regression pinned in `test_static.py`)

## Issue 150: OBS live-feed capture — continuous program feed (ToS-clean source)

**Status**: ☐ Planned (concrete) — **extends Issue 95**, requested 2026-06-17
**Depends on**: 95 (companion app + API-key upload seam already exist)

**Why this matters (the ToS angle):** Downloading a creator's own YouTube video bytes via
`yt-dlp` is barred by the YouTube **API Services** ToS even for own content — which is why
the only compliant clip path today is creator-initiated upload (`COMPLIANCE.md` §5, Issue
139). **Capturing from OBS sidesteps that entirely**: the bytes come from the creator's own
local capture, never from YouTube's API. This is the strategic "grab the live feed from OBS
itself, not YouTube" path.

**Scope vs Issue 95:** Issue 95 is the *manual replay-buffer hotkey* model — the streamer
presses OBS's replay-save and the companion app folder-watches the output dir and uploads
that one clip. Issue 150 is the *continuous* model: capture the **whole live session** so
AutoClip can analyze it end-to-end and *auto-suggest* clips from anywhere in the stream (the
North-Star "knows your channel" loop applied live), not only the moments the creator flagged.

**Approach (concrete):**
1. **Transport: `obs-websocket` v5** — built into OBS 28+ (no plugin install). The companion
   app authenticates to the local OBS WebSocket (password from OBS settings, stored in the OS
   keyring next to the existing API key).
2. **Continuous capture**: companion app issues `StartRecord` (or taps the configured
   recording output) at stream start; on `StopRecord` (or a rolling segment boundary) it
   uploads the session file(s) via the existing API-key endpoint. Prefer **segmented
   recording** (OBS "Automatic File Splitting", e.g. 10-min chunks) so upload + ingest
   pipeline during a long stream instead of waiting for the whole session.
3. **Pipeline reuse**: each uploaded segment enters the normal
   `ingest → transcribe → build_signals → score` chain; clips land in `/review` exactly like
   uploaded source — DNA + preference ranking apply unchanged.
4. **On-demand still supported**: trigger OBS `SaveReplayBuffer` over the same WebSocket so
   the creator can flag a moment from anywhere (Issue 95's UX, minus the second hotkey).

**Open design questions (resolve in Phase 1 CHECK):**
- Upload mechanics for long sessions: chunked multipart vs resumable (tus) vs presigned R2
  PUT direct from the companion app (keeps large bytes off the API pods).
- Minutes/billing: continuous capture can run hours — confirm the per-minute meter + refund
  policy still fit, or add a "live session" plan affordance.
- Privacy/retention: session media follows `SOURCE_MEDIA_RETENTION_HOURS` purge like any
  upload; confirm no extra exposure (`COMPLIANCE.md`).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Companion app connects to OBS via obs-websocket v5 (auth via keyring)
- [ ] Continuous/segmented capture uploads session media via the API-key seam
- [ ] Uploaded segments run the standard ingest→signals→clip pipeline; clips in `/review`
- [ ] On-demand `SaveReplayBuffer` path retained
- [ ] Zero YouTube API bytes involved — documented as the ToS-clean source path
- [ ] Billing + retention behaviour confirmed for long live sessions

## Issue 151: Beta logging to a dedicated logs database

**Status**: ◐ In progress (2026-06-17)

**What**: Persist UI + backend events to a dedicated append-only logs store (today they only
hit the rotating `app.log` file via `observability.log_event` + `/api/activity`, Issue 122).
Every click / submit / navigation and key backend process gets a queryable row for beta
analysis. **Hard invariant: no PII, no OAuth tokens, no secrets** ever land in a log row
(redaction at the boundary; per-creator id only). Dedicated logical store so high-volume
telemetry never contends with the primary OLTP path.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Dedicated logs table(s) + migration; append-only; indexed for query
- [ ] Single sink fed by both the UI activity endpoint and backend events
- [ ] Redaction guard (no email/token/secret) with a test that proves it
- [ ] Per-creator isolation on reads; admin/query surface
- [ ] Retention policy documented (COMPLIANCE.md)

## Issue 152: Pro chatbot — streaming assistant scoped to the creator's own channel

**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-17) — built; CI-authoritative for migration 0026 + isolation integration test
**Depends on**: 151 (reuse the SSE primitive), Pro tier gating

**What**: An interactive, *streaming* assistant for Pro users that helps them navigate the
UI and interpret their analytics — like the Analyze feature, but conversational, with
**tool-use scoped to the requesting creator's own DNA/analytics** (per-creator isolation on
every tool call). Anthropic streaming reusing the SSE primitive; React chat page.

**Delivered:** `chat/` package (`prompt.py` cached honesty-constrained system prompt;
`tools.py` 5 creator-scoped tools — DNA / recent videos / video performance / channel
averages / upload timing; `runner.py` manual agentic streaming loop). New
`worker/anthropic_stream.stream_message` (full-message return for the tool loop) +
`worker.tasks.chat_respond`. `routers/chat.py` (gate + daily quota + SSE enqueue + list/get/
regenerate/delete). Models `ChatConversation`/`ChatMessage` + migration **0026** (RLS on the
conversation table). React `/app/chat` page reusing `taskStream`. Config:
`CHAT_DAILY_MESSAGE_LIMIT`/`CHAT_MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`/`CHAT_MAX_TOKENS`/`CHAT_HISTORY_TURNS`.
Gate model + agentic-loop choice recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-17).

**Acceptance criteria** (refined in CHECK):
- [x] Gate = active creator (positive balance OR live trial); non-active → 402 + upgrade affordance
- [x] Per-creator daily message quota (429 past the cap)
- [x] Streaming responses; stop/regenerate
- [x] Tools fetch ONLY the requesting creator's data (isolation integration test — CI)
- [x] Tool-loop capped (≤4); `max_tokens` + 8-turn history truncation
- [x] No virality promise; honesty constraint in the system prompt (structural test)
- [x] Prompt caching engaged + per-message token logging per `/claude-api` best practices
- [x] Conversation persists server-side; reads scoped to the owning creator
- [x] React `/app/chat` page; unit suite green (993); ruff + mypy + bandit clean; frontend lint/build/vitest green

## Issue 85 Overhaul — Regression & Gap Audit (filed 2026-06-18)

> Issues 153–159 were produced by a 6-dimension behavioral-parity audit of the Issue 85
> React/TS soft cutover (`/` → `/app/dashboard`; legacy `static/*.html` kept as unlinked
> rollback). The audit found the SPA silently became the primary surface while dropping
> several behaviors the old pages had. Tracing/observability and security dimensions came
> back **clean** (middleware stack unchanged; no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; server-side auth
> boundary intact). The honesty/"no virality" invariant is intact. Worked in priority order.

## Issue 153: [BLOCKER] Restore ToS/Privacy footer on Onboarding & Walkthrough (OAuth-verification gate)

**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-18) — pending deploy of `frontend/dist`

**Delivered:** Imported the shared `<Footer/>` component (reused, not re-hand-rolled like
`Login.tsx`) into `Onboarding.tsx` and `Walkthrough.tsx`, pinned to the bottom (`mt-auto w-full`)
since both routes sit outside `AppChrome`. Per-page tests assert both links resolve to
`/static/tos.html` + `/static/privacy.html`. No routing/architecture change. Frontend
lint + vitest (34) + build all green.

**What**: The React `Onboarding` and `Walkthrough` routes are nested under `AuthGate` but
*outside* `AppChrome`, so they never render the shared `<Footer/>` that links
`/static/tos.html` + `/static/privacy.html`. The old `static/onboarding.html` (lines 477–478)
and `static/walkthrough.html` (lines 300–301) both carried those links. **Onboarding is a
first-run surface Google's OAuth reviewer walks through** — a missing ToS/Privacy link is a
verification-gate breach (the "ToS + Privacy live AND linked from every page" invariant,
Issue 29 / CLAUDE.md Pre-Public-Launch). Root cause is structural: both routes deliberately
use a minimal nav (no `AppChrome`) and that inadvertently dropped the footer too.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] `Onboarding.tsx` renders ToS + Privacy links (shared `Footer` or inline), resolving to the served `/static/tos.html` + `/static/privacy.html`
- [x] `Walkthrough.tsx` renders the same
- [x] A test asserts both routes expose both links (mirror the static-page footer test)
- [x] Honesty disclaimer remains present on both (already OK — don't regress it)
- [x] `frontend` lint/build/vitest green

## Issue 154: [SEV1] Walkthrough primary CTA dead-ends into legacy `/static/onboarding.html`

**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-18) — pending deploy of `frontend/dist`

**What**: The Walkthrough's terminal "Set up my AutoClip" CTA (and the Enter-key handler) did
a full-page `window.location.href = '/static/onboarding.html'`, bouncing a first-run user out
of the SPA into a rollback-only legacy page mid-onboarding. The ported route already exists at
`/app/onboarding` (`App.tsx:37`).

**Delivered:** `Walkthrough` now hands off via `useNavigate('/onboarding')` (in-SPA, no reload);
`markWalkthroughSeen` split from the navigation; CTA + Enter handler both use it. Audit-found a
**second** dead-end the original report missed — `DashboardBanners.tsx` fell back to
`?? '/static/onboarding.html'` for unknown setup steps; changed to `/app/onboarding`. Grep
confirms no remaining SPA link into a `/static/*.html` user page (only ToS/Privacy, by design).
Test asserts the finish hand-off lands on an in-SPA route (stub `/onboarding`), not a full-page
exit. Frontend lint + vitest (34) + build green.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Walkthrough CTA + Enter handler navigate within the SPA (`useNavigate('/onboarding')`)
- [x] Grep confirms no SPA code links into `/static/*.html` user pages (ToS/Privacy excepted — those are the canonical served docs); also fixed the `DashboardBanners` fallback
- [x] Test covers the CTA target (asserts in-SPA navigation)
- [x] `frontend` lint/build/vitest green

## Issue 155: [SEV2] Restore frontend UI telemetry in the SPA (`/api/activity`)

**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-18) — pending deploy of `frontend/dist`; prod row-level confirmation after deploy
**Logged**: `docs/OFF_COURSE_BUGS.md` 2026-06-18

**Delivered:** `lib/activity.ts` (fire-and-forget `sendActivity` + delegated capture-phase
click/submit listeners, ported from `static/activity.js`; uses `textContent` not browser-only
`innerText`; slices `page`/`target` to the server's Pydantic limits so a long title can't 422).
`hooks/useActivityTelemetry.ts` installs the listeners once and emits `navigate` on initial load
+ every React Router location change. Wired via a new `RootLayout` wrapping all routes in
`App.tsx`. Test asserts all three event types (`navigate` on load + route change, `click`) POST
to `/api/activity`. Backend endpoint + `event_logs` sink were already healthy (confirmed live).

**What**: The old static pages loaded `static/activity.js`, which fired fire-and-forget
`POST /api/activity` on every click, form submit, and navigation. The React SPA has **zero**
callers of `/api/activity`, so all client UI telemetry has been dark since the cutover —
route changes (the highest-signal SPA event) emit nothing. The backend endpoint
(`routers/activity.py`), the file sink (`observability.log_event`), and the `event_logs` DB
sink (`event_log.record_event`, Issue 151) are all healthy and waiting for data. Verified on
prod: only 5 `ui` rows ever, all pre-cutover; current sessions log `backend`/`http_request`
rows but no `ui` rows.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] SPA emits `navigate` events on React Router route change (a `useLocation` effect)
- [x] SPA emits `click`/`submit` events (delegated listeners), matching the existing `ActivityEvent` shape (`page`, `event_type`, `target`, `extra`)
- [x] Instrumented app-wide via `RootLayout` (covers all routes, including the 6 authed/funnel surfaces); pre-auth pages now also covered (login/pricing) — a deliberate superset, low volume
- [x] No PII/token in any emitted `extra` (only `href` on links; redaction also enforced server-side)
- [~] Verified end-to-end: unit test proves the POST shape; live `source='ui'` row confirmation pending deploy
- [x] `frontend` lint/build/vitest green

## Issue 156: [SEV3] Fix stale Walkthrough "activity panel" copy (panel rebuild → Issue 160)

**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-18) — pending deploy of `frontend/dist`

**What**: Walkthrough step-04 told users "the **activity panel** in the bottom right shows live
progress… the panel follows you" — a feature the static app had (`activeTasks.js` +
`activityPanel.js`) but the React cutover dropped. Rather than rush the panel rebuild into this
batch, the false copy is corrected to match the shipped reality (the dashboard shows per-row
status and auto-refreshes), and the cross-page panel itself is promoted to its own focused issue
(**160**) — the 3-slot SSE cap (`MAX_CONCURRENT_SSE_PER_CREATOR=3`) makes it a
single-EventSource-owner refactor, not a drop-in. Descope recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Walkthrough step-04 copy matches the shipped reality (no promised panel)
- [x] Panel rebuild re-filed as Issue 160 with the architectural constraint captured
- [x] `frontend` lint/build/vitest green

## Issue 157: [SEV2] Insights page — loading state + surface sub-fetch errors

**Status**: ✅ Done (2026-06-18) — pending deploy of `frontend/dist`

**What**: `Insights.tsx` only branched on `insightsQuery.isError`. During the normal initial
fetch (`isPending`), `data` was undefined so the snapshots rendered nothing and the performer
panels showed their "Build your DNA to surface this list." empty copy — misleading for a user
who *has* DNA and is just waiting on the fetch. Separately, `upload-intel` and `saved-insights`
errors were swallowed (indistinguishable from a genuine empty state).

**Delivered:** Insights body now gates `isPending → loading → isError → content`; gating on
`isPending` also fixes the performer flicker (in the success branch `data` is defined, so the
"Build your DNA" empty text only shows when genuinely empty). `UploadWindows` and `SavedInsights`
take an `isError` prop and render a distinct error line ("Could not load timing data." /
"Could not load saved insights.") instead of the empty state. Tests cover the loading state and
the upload-intel error path. Frontend lint + vitest (37) + build green.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [x] Insights body gates on `isPending` with a loading state (no misleading empty/"build DNA" copy mid-load)
- [x] `upload-intel` and `saved-insights` `isError` states surface distinctly from genuine empty
- [x] Performer "Build your DNA" empty text shows only after the query settles
- [x] `frontend` lint/build/vitest green

## Issue 158: [SEV2] Account-deletion UI — right-to-erasure (`DELETE /auth/me`)

**Status**: ☐ Not started
**Note**: Pre-existing gap (not an Issue 85 regression) — surfaced by the audit's orphaned-endpoint sweep.

**What**: `DELETE /auth/me` (token revocation + media purge) exists in `routers/auth.py:204`
but has **no UI caller** in either the old static pages or the SPA. CLAUDE.md Pre-Public-Launch
lists "Account-deletion endpoint (right-to-erasure: token revocation + media purge)" as a
launch requirement. The backend is done; the user-facing affordance is missing.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Profile (or settings) surfaces an account-deletion affordance with a confirm step
- [ ] Calls `DELETE /auth/me`; on success, clears session and routes to a logged-out/confirmation state
- [ ] Honest copy on what is purged (tokens + media) per COMPLIANCE.md
- [ ] Test covers the delete flow
- [ ] `frontend` lint/build/vitest green

## Issue 159: [cleanup] Orphaned-endpoint & dead-affordance sweep

**Status**: ☐ Not started

**What**: The audit confirmed several endpoints/affordances now dead from the UI (mostly
pre-existing, surfaced by the cutover). Triage each: wire it into the SPA or retire it (with a
`docs/DECISIONS.md` note for anything removed).
- `GET /videos/{id}/status` (`routers/videos.py:397`) — superseded by the `/videos` list `refetchInterval`; no UI caller. Retire or document.
- `GET /creators/me/identity/history` (`routers/creators.py:439`) — no caller; Profile shows current identity only.
- `GET /logs/me` (`routers/logs.py:21`) — operator/self read surface; no UI caller (intentional? document).
- Dead "Upload source file to clip" CTA — non-functional copy in both old and new UI (`VideoTable.tsx:122`); the web UI never POSTs `/videos/upload` (OBS/API-key path only). Clarify or wire.
- Dashboard ignores the `/videos` empty-envelope `next_action` (`Dashboard.tsx`); the not-connected branch is unreachable post-auth dead weight — consume it or drop it from the envelope.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Each item above either wired into the SPA or retired with a one-line `DECISIONS.md` rationale
- [ ] No orphaned router endpoint left undocumented
- [ ] Tests/`/assess` Layer 0 green; no coverage regression

## Issue 160: [SEV2] Cross-page active-tasks panel (single-owner SSE store)

**Status**: ☐ Not started — carved out of Issue 156 (2026-06-18)

**What**: Restore the cross-page background-job visibility the static app had (a persistent
bottom-right "activity panel" that followed the user across pages, streaming catalog sync / DNA
build / improvement brief / video analysis via `/tasks/{id}/events`). The React cutover bound
each job's progress to its originating page's local `useTaskStream`, so navigating away mid-job
loses live progress (the job continues server-side; status stays visible via the dashboard
`/videos` poll, so this is degraded, not broken).

**Design constraint (load-bearing):** `routers/tasks.py:48` caps SSE at
`MAX_CONCURRENT_SSE_PER_CREATOR = 3`. A panel that streams every active task *plus* a page
streaming the current task would exhaust the cap. So the global store must be the **single
EventSource owner per task**, and the existing streaming sites must read progress *from the
store* rather than opening their own connection. In an SPA an in-memory React context naturally
"follows the user" across client-side navigation — the old `localStorage` cross-page machinery
(`static/activeTasks.js`) is unnecessary (it existed only because the static app full-reloaded
on every navigation).

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] A global `ActiveTasks` context: single `EventSource` per registered task; auto-prunes on `done`/`error`
- [ ] Persistent panel in `AppChrome` (collapsed badge → expand to per-task progress); hidden when idle
- [ ] The 4 streaming sites (Onboarding catalog+DNA, profile `DnaCard`, Insights `ImprovementBrief`, Analysis) register tasks and read progress from the store — no double-subscribe (respects the 3-slot cap)
- [ ] Their existing on-`done` behaviors preserved (e.g. Onboarding query invalidations)
- [ ] Walkthrough step-04 copy updated to describe the panel
- [ ] Tests cover the store lifecycle + panel render; `frontend` lint/build/vitest green

## Phase 3 Backlog (post-production)

Items deferred until the product is live and stable:
- Thumbnail rendering (DALL-E / Stable Diffusion integration — follows Issue 129 concepts)
- Vision signals (MediaPipe / face-emotion) — Phase 2
- Auto-publish to YouTube Shorts (additional OAuth scope)
- Multi-platform export (TikTok / Reels)
- Hot-key clipping during live recording / OBS integration → promoted to **Issue 150** (continuous OBS capture)
- No-auth demo mode (full processing without signup — follows Issue 136 hero)
- Per-Short mini-editor: left/right arrow to browse Shorts one-by-one with an inline
  crop/clip/cut/subtitle/font tool + a feedback comment box (salvaged from KICKSTART
  "aspirations", Issue 146)
- All-in-one direction: grow toward an editor / analyzer / video+audio management hub so
  creators keep everything together (salvaged from KICKSTART "aspirations", Issue 146)
