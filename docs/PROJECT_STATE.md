## Current Status

**Active issue**: Phase 2 hardening — Batch 3 (worker/tasks.py-heavy; serial). Issue 39 ✅ done; next: 43 / 47 / 46 / 57.
**Last completed**: Issue 39 — Celery event-loop strategy (per-worker singleton loop + engine rebind on `worker_process_init`)
**Blocked**: _(none)_

> **Closed Issue 39** (2026-05-28 — Batch 3 kickoff): Celery event-loop strategy.
> Every task previously called `asyncio.run(...)`, creating a fresh loop per
> invocation and rebinding the SQLAlchemy async engine pool to whichever loop
> touched it first — the textbook cause of "Future attached to a different loop"
> + pool churn under concurrency. Fix: per-worker singleton `asyncio` loop installed
> by the `worker_process_init` Celery signal, and the engine rebound to that loop
> via new `db.recreate_engine()` (uses `engine.sync_engine.dispose(close=False)`
> to abandon inherited parent connections without yanking parent FDs). All 11 task
> bodies in `worker/tasks.py` now route through `worker.celery_app.run_async(coro)`.
> Switched `worker/tasks.py` from `from db import AsyncSessionLocal` to `import db`
> + `db.AsyncSessionLocal(...)` so the rebound sessionmaker is picked up at call time.
> Test count: **367 passed, 1 skipped, 41 deselected** (+5 new event-loop tests).
> Adjusted patch targets in `test_retention_tasks.py` / `test_pipeline_trigger.py` /
> `test_oauth_lifecycle.py` to match the new import surface.

> **Closed Batch 2** (2026-05-28 PM): Three TEST-ONLY issues via parallel agents.
>
> - **Issue 49**: 4 integration tests for the billing money paths (concurrent deduct
>   race, webhook idempotency same session_id, unknown pack_id, missing metadata).
>   Finding: webhook returns 200 `{"status": "ignored"}` for anomalies, NOT 4xx — this
>   is the correct Stripe pattern (2xx prevents retry storms; anomalies logged internally).
>   Tests document and assert the actual behavior.
> - **Issue 51**: 4 new tests appended to `tests/test_oauth_lifecycle.py` (now 15 total):
>   refresh-path success, callback caplog no-plaintext, authorization URL exact scopes
>   (no `youtube.upload`), `prompt=consent` + `access_type=offline` round-trip.
> - **Issue 55**: 9 surgical load-bearing tests across 8 existing files + 1 adversarial
>   YAML scenario (`loud_aftermath.yaml`).
>
> One merge-flow defect caught during Batch 2: Issue 51's new
> `test_callback_logs_no_token_plaintext` drives the full callback success path, which
> sets a `cc_session` JWT cookie on the session-scoped TestClient cookie jar — leaking
> auth into subsequent tests and causing `test_static::test_list_videos_requires_auth`
> to hit real Postgres. Fix: clear `client.cookies` in the finally block and `pop` only
> the dependency override this test set instead of `.clear()` (the project convention).
>
> Test count: **362 passed, 1 skipped, 41 deselected** (was 349; +13 unit / +4 integration).

> **Closed Batch 1** (2026-05-28 PM): Six issues landed via parallel agents in
> isolated worktrees, merged serially into main with full suite green after each merge.
>
> - **Issue 37** (SEV-1, SDK timeouts): module-level singletons for Anthropic / Stripe /
>   Voyage / boto3 with timeout + retry config. Anthropic 60s/2-retry, 120s override for
>   improvement_brief web_search path. Stripe `max_network_retries=3`. Voyage `timeout=30`
>   wrapped in tenacity (3 attempts, exp backoff). boto3 adaptive retry, max_attempts=5,
>   connect/read 10/60. Added `tenacity==9.1.4` to requirements.
> - **Issue 45** (SEV-2, refresh race + Redis pool): per-creator `SET NX EX 10` lock around
>   the Google refresh branch with canonical Lua compare-and-delete release. Module-level
>   `redis.asyncio.Redis` singleton in new `youtube/_redis.py` shared by oauth + quota.
> - **Issue 48** (TESTS): 14 new integration tests covering every protected route — zero
>   SEV-0 isolation findings (all routes correctly enforce per-creator filtering).
> - **Issue 50** (TESTS): 4 integration tests verifying cascade across all 17 dependent
>   tables; no missed FK cascades.
> - **Issue 53** (TESTS): renamed misnomered `test_compliance.py` → `test_retention_tasks.py`;
>   new `test_compliance_no_virality.py` with 3 structural scans (OpenAPI bodies, static
>   assets, schema descriptions). Codebase clean — no forbidden phrases.
> - **Issue 54** (TESTS): 3 integration tests for `scripts/rotate_token_key.py` —
>   happy-path full re-encrypt, corrupt-row rollback, caplog no-plaintext.
>
> Test count: **349 passed, 1 skipped, 37 deselected** (was 335 + 16 deselected;
> +14 unit / +21 integration). See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-28 entries for Issues 37, 45.

> **Closed Issue 36** (2026-05-28): Three lifecycle gaps closed in one commit.
> (a) `DELETE /auth/me` now revokes the **refresh** token at
> `oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke` and tolerates 400 `invalid_token` / `token_revoked` as
> success — completes the right-to-erasure path. (b) `get_valid_access_token` now deletes
> the `YoutubeToken` row + commits on Google `invalid_grant` (RFC 6749 §5.2 permanent
> error), so subsequent refresh attempts immediately surface the existing
> "No OAuth tokens found — please reconnect" 401 instead of looping. (c) New
> `youtube/errors.py` (`YouTubeAuthError` + `PERMANENT_403_REASONS` / `TRANSIENT_403_REASONS`
> sets); `_get_json` and `_fetch_report` share a `_classify_error()` helper that retries
> transient 403/429 with exponential backoff and raises `YouTubeAuthError` on permanent
> 401 / 403 reasons (authError, forbidden, accountClosed, accountSuspended, channelClosed,
> ...). `worker/tasks.py::_refresh_youtube_analytics_async` catches `YouTubeAuthError`,
> deletes the offending `YoutubeToken` row, commits, and continues — eliminates the
> hourly-wasted-quota loop against revoked creators. "Mark creator disconnected" is
> represented as token-row absence (no `OnboardingState` enum change, no migration).
> 9 new tests in `tests/test_oauth_lifecycle.py`. Test count: **335 passed, 1 skipped,
> 16 deselected** (was 326; +9 new). See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-28 Issue 36 entry.

> **Closed Issue 41**: `preference/model.py:35–40` used `pickle.dumps(self)` / `pickle.loads(data)`
> for `PreferenceScorer.to_bytes` / `from_bytes`.  Any future write to `preference_models.weights_blob`
> (SQL injection, admin import, a bug) would become RCE in the worker process on the next ranking pass.
> Replaced with **joblib** (sklearn's documented serialiser; already a transitive dep) backed by
> `_RestrictedUnpickler` — a subclass of `joblib.numpy_pickle.NumpyUnpickler` that overrides
> `find_class` with a hardcoded allowlist of 10 `(module, name)` pairs.  `from_bytes` temporarily
> patches `joblib.numpy_pickle.NumpyUnpickler` with the restricted class for the duration of the
> `joblib.load` call, then restores the original (no global state left behind).  No schema change —
> `weights_blob` column stays `bytes`.  4 new tests in `tests/test_preference.py`: round-trip
> (predictions identical), label_count preserved, `os.system` gadget rejected, `subprocess.Popen`
> gadget rejected.  Test count delta: +3 net (renamed 1 existing test, added 4, kept all others green).
> See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-28 Issue 41 entry.
>
> **Closed Issue 42**: `clip_engine/render.py` had three `subprocess.run` calls with no
> `timeout=`. A stalled or corrupt source video would block the Celery worker indefinitely.
> Fixed: `_run` now accepts `timeout_s: float = 120.0` and catches `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`,
> re-raising as `RuntimeError(f"ffmpeg {label} timed out after {timeout_s}s")`. `_frame_dimensions`
> hardcodes `timeout=30` directly (ffprobe reads only the container header). `render_clip_file`
> computes `render_timeout_s = max(120.0, duration * 4)` and passes it to both the keyframe
> extraction and the final render `_run` call. 3 new tests in `tests/test_render.py` assert
> each timeout path raises the correct `RuntimeError` without any real sleeping (all using
> `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` side-effects). Test count: 311 passed + 3 new = 314 expected
> (test env currently broken by a langsmith/pydantic-core version conflict introduced between
> sessions — see environment note below). See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-28 Issue 42 entry.
>
> **ENVIRONMENT NOTE (2026-05-28)**: `python3.12 -m pytest -q` now fails at plugin-loading
> time with `SystemError: pydantic-core 2.27.2 incompatible with pydantic requiring 2.46.4`.
> Cause: langsmith installed a newer pydantic (2.46.4) into the uv-managed Python at
> `~/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.7/` while the user site at `~/.local/lib/python3.12/`
> still has pydantic-core 2.27.2. The fix is: `python3.12 -m pip install --user --break-system-packages
> "pydantic-core>=2.46.4"` OR use the project venv at `.venv/bin/pytest`. This is an environment
> issue, not a code issue.
>
> **2026-05-28 session note**: Ran a full project audit before resuming work. Discovered 24
> hardening + coverage findings (4 SEV-0, 12 SEV-1, 3 SEV-2, 8 test-coverage), filed as
> Issues 32–55 in `docs/issues.md` under **Phase 2: Hardening & Test Coverage**.
> **Closed Issue 32**: `starlette` had drifted to 1.1.0 (a major-version upstream released
> 2026-05-23 under the new `Kludex/starlette` maintainership) and `pytest` could not even
> collect — the previously-claimed "313 tests pass" was stale. Pinned `starlette==0.41.3`
> explicitly in `requirements.txt` (inside FastAPI 0.115.x's `<0.42.0,>=0.40.0` constraint),
> re-installed via a project venv, and confirmed **313 passed, 7 deselected** (the 7 are
> integration-marked). See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-28 entry.
> **Closed Issue 33**: `routers/improvement.py` was sending other creators' analytics
> averages to Claude for every requesting creator (`select(VideoMetrics).limit(50)` with no
> `creator_id` filter — SEV-0 isolation leak). Fixed via the always-filter idiom already
> used elsewhere (`.join(Video).where(Video.creator_id == creator.id)`) plus an
> `ORDER BY fetched_at DESC` for determinism, plus a zero-data 400 short-circuit so
> brand-new creators don't get a hallucinated brief. New integration test
> `tests/test_improvement_isolation.py` seeds two creators with disjoint metrics and asserts
> only the requesting creator's data reaches the LLM. Filed **Issue 56** (Postgres RLS
> evaluation) as defense-in-depth follow-up. See `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` "Findings & Fixes
> Log" 2026-05-28 entry.
> **Closed Issue 34**: `worker/tasks.py:189` called `deduct_minutes` with no per-video
> idempotency key. With Celery's `task_acks_late=True`, a worker-crash-between-commit-and-ack
> would re-deliver the ingest task and re-decrement the balance (up to 4× per video).
> Replaced with a new `MinuteDeduction` ledger table (symmetric to `MinutePack` grants),
> `UNIQUE(video_id)` as the idempotency key, and `deduct_for_video` using SAVEPOINT
> (`session.begin_nested`) to atomically INSERT the ledger row + decrement balance. New
> migration `0003_minute_deductions.py`. 4 real-Postgres integration tests in
> `tests/test_billing_idempotency.py` cover sequential retry, two-coroutine concurrent
> race, 402-leaves-ledger-clean, and audit fields. Test count: **311 passed, 13
> deselected** (net 0 — removed 2 mocked unit tests, added 4 integration tests). Filed
> **Issue 57** (refund-on-terminal-failure) as product follow-up. See `docs/DECISIONS.md`
> 2026-05-28 Issue 34 entry.
>
> **2026-05-28 session note (Issue 40)**: Replaced `await file.read(max_bytes + 1)` bulk-read
> (SEV-1: up to 500 MB into heap per request) with a 1 MB streaming chunk loop. Temp file is
> always unlinked on the 413 rejection path via `except HTTPException`. 3 new tests in
> `tests/test_videos_upload_streaming.py`: 413 on oversize, tempfile cleanup verified, RSS delta
> asserted < 20 MB for a 100 MB rejected upload. Test count: **314 passed** (net +3).
> See `docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-28 Issue 40 entry.

> **2026-05-28 session note**: Completed Issue 44 (auth boundary hardening). Three security
> fixes: (1) `auth.py` `get_current_creator` now catches `ValueError`/`KeyError` alongside
> `PyJWTError` so a malformed JWT `sub` returns 401 instead of 500; (2) `DELETE /auth/me` rate-
> limited to 5/hour via the existing slowapi limiter; (3) `crypto.py` rewritten to use
> `MultiFernet` for zero-downtime key rotation + typed `TokenDecryptError`. Added
> `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` optional setting. Test count delta: +8 tests (2 in
> `test_auth.py`, 6 in `test_crypto.py` replacing 1 old test). All existing tests updated for
> the new rate-limit requirement on `DELETE /me`.

> **2026-05-27 session note**: Built the operability kit (Issue 31). Found and fixed a
> **blocking pre-existing bug** — `routers/clips.py` imported the deleted `billing.tiers`, so
> `import main` failed and the app could not start (likely a real cause of failed/timed-out
> deploys). Fixed to the minute-packs `check_positive_balance` guard. Full suite now `313 passed`.
> Note: CI lint (`ruff check .`) has ~11 pre-existing violations unrelated to this work — flagged,
> not swept in. The local unprovisioned `.env` is missing most required vars (dev only).

> **2026-05-28 session note**: Fixed SEV-0 Issue 35 — idempotent DNA build. `create_draft`,
> `embed_patterns`, `embed_brief` all gained `commit=False` path; `_build_dna_async` now
> issues a single atomic commit. 3 integration tests added in `tests/test_dna_build_idempotency.py`
> (marked `integration`; excluded from default `pytest -q` run per pytest.ini). Non-integration
> suite count unchanged at `313 passed`.
