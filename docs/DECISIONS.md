# CreatorClip — Design Decisions Log

Entries are added whenever an architectural decision is made, a library is chosen, or
implementation diverges from the PRD. Every entry must include what, why, source/evidence, and date.

## 2026-05-25 — Project Kickoff Decisions

### North Star Sentence

**What**: Settled on the north star: *"The only AI editor that truly knows your channel —
it learns your style from your own analytics, adapts as you evolve, and keeps you ahead of
the algorithm."*

**Why**: The product is broader than clipping — it's a full analyzer + advisor that adapts to
the creator's evolving style and keeps them informed about algorithm changes. The sentence must
communicate the personalization flywheel, not just the clip output.

**Source**: Creator (owner) input, 2026-05-25.

### Review UI: Single Player + Next

**What**: The review interface is a single-player + Next button, not a swipe-stack.

**Why**: Single-player makes precision trim handle interaction easier and more reliable.
Swipe-stack UX is faster for bulk review but sacrifices the trim-delta signal, which is the
strongest *timing* feedback. Trim handles are the visual centerpiece.

**Source**: Creator input, 2026-05-25.

### Pricing Model: Usage-Based Tiers (Research Pending)

**What**: Pricing is usage-based with tiered subscription floors, similar to Anthropic's own
model. A flat "low cap" monthly plan would frustrate prolific creators. A pure per-video model
adds friction.

**Why**: Creators' output volume varies enormously. A tiered usage model (e.g., base plan
includes N tokens/videos, then pay-as-you-go overage) aligns cost with value and doesn't
block high-output creators.

**Research needed**: Best practices for usage-based SaaS pricing + Stripe metered billing
implementation. Must be decided before public launch. Stripe + usage metering is the
industry-standard path.

**Source**: Creator input, 2026-05-25. Research not yet completed — see `docs/SOT.md` Known
Production Gaps.

### Production Deployment: GKE Autopilot + Helm + KEDA

**What**: GKE Autopilot is the production K8s platform. Helm charts in
`deploy/charts/creatorclip/`. KEDA ScaledObject autoscales Celery workers on Redis
queue depth. PgBouncer sidecar handles connection pooling. Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL 16
(pgvector enabled). GCP Secret Manager + External Secrets Operator for secrets.

**Why GKE Autopilot over EKS/DO**:
- No node management — Google provisions and upgrades nodes automatically
- Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL 16 has first-class pgvector support (vs. RDS which requires
  custom parameter groups and is slower to enable extensions)
- GCP Secret Manager + Workload Identity = cleanest managed-secrets story without extra agents
- Spot node pools for transcription workers available when we add WhisperX
- Familiarity: same provider as Cloudflare Tunnel integration already in dev

**KEDA vs HPA-only**: HPA on CPU is insufficient for Celery — a backlogged queue does
not spike CPU until workers are already overwhelmed. KEDA's `redis-listLength` trigger
scales on actual work queued, providing proactive scaling.

**PgBouncer sidecar vs RDS Proxy**: Sidecar eliminates the network hop to a separate
pooler, is free, and transaction mode allows up to 25 upstream connections per pod
(→ 750 at 30 pods, well within Cloud SQL's 1,000 limit).

**Source**: Compared providers on pgvector support, managed node overhead, secrets
integration, and community KEDA+Celery patterns. 2026-05-26.

### OAuth HTTP Calls: httpx Instead of google-auth-oauthlib

**What**: The OAuth token exchange, token refresh, userinfo, and YouTube Channels calls are
implemented directly with `httpx.AsyncClient` rather than using `google-auth-oauthlib` /
`google-api-python-client`.

**Why**: `google-auth-oauthlib` is synchronous — using it in an async FastAPI handler requires
`asyncio.run_in_executor()` boilerplate. The OAuth endpoints are simple POST/GET calls that
`httpx` handles natively in 3–4 lines each. Fewer dependencies, fully async, and easier to
test (patch the `_call_*` helpers rather than monkey-patching Google internals).

**Source**: httpx docs; FastAPI async best practices. Confirmed: no Google library provides
a first-party async implementation as of 2026-05.

---

### Numeric Thresholds Set as Defaults

**What**: The following defaults were set based on the kickstart document's suggested values:

| Variable | Default | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `CLIPS_PER_VIDEO_DEFAULT` | 8 | Enough candidates to cover diverse moments without overwhelming review |
| `MIN_VIDEOS_FOR_DNA` | 10 | Minimum for meaningful top/bottom performer analysis |
| `MIN_SHORTS_FOR_DNA` | 5 | Minimum for Shorts-specific pattern extraction |
| `PERSONALIZATION_THRESHOLD_LABELS` | 20 | Minimum feedback volume for reranker to produce meaningful signal |

All are environment-configurable and can be tuned once real usage data exists.

**Source**: Kickstart document defaults; no external research needed (tunable post-launch).

---

### Postgres Docker Image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16

**What**: Using `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` in docker-compose instead of `postgres:16` + manual
extension install.

**Why**: The official pgvector Docker image pre-installs the extension, eliminating the
`CREATE EXTENSION` step that frequently trips up fresh setups. Same underlying Postgres 16;
no functional difference.

**Source**: pgvector GitHub README recommendation, standard practice.

---

### Transcription Backend: Deepgram as MVP Default

**What**: `TRANSCRIPTION_BACKEND` defaults to `"deepgram"` (hosted API). WhisperX remains
available via `TRANSCRIPTION_BACKEND=whisperx` for self-hosted GPU deployments. The
`DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` field is already in Settings (optional, empty default).

**Why**: No GPU infrastructure exists for the MVP. Deepgram's Nova-3 model provides
word-level timestamps, speaker diarization, and competitive accuracy without the operational
overhead of managing a GPU box or container. WhisperX is preserved as a config-selectable
path for production cost optimisation once volume justifies the GPU spend.

**Source**: Resolves the "Transcription compute" open research item. Decision: hosted API
for MVP, self-hosted as a future cost lever. 2026-05-25.

### asyncio.run() in Celery Tasks

**What**: Celery task functions (`ingest_video`, `transcribe_video`, `build_signals`) use
`asyncio.run()` to call async SQLAlchemy helpers. Each task creates a fresh event loop
per invocation.

**Why**: Celery workers are process-based and synchronous by default. The project's
SQLAlchemy setup is async-only (`create_async_engine`). The alternatives — a parallel sync
engine or `nest_asyncio` — add more complexity. `asyncio.run()` is the documented SQLAlchemy
approach for non-async call sites, and Celery workers run in their own processes so there is
no event-loop conflict.

**Source**: SQLAlchemy async docs "Using Asyncio" section; Celery docs recommend keeping
task functions synchronous. 2026-05-25.

## 2026-05-26 — Billing: Minute Packs (replaces subscription tiers)

**What**: Billing model is pre-paid minute packs, not subscriptions. `Creator.plan_tier` and
`Creator.subscription_status` replaced with `Creator.minutes_balance` (int) and a
`minute_packs` ledger table. Stripe Checkout in one-time payment mode — no subscriptions,
no Billing Meters. Five purchasable packs (Starter 200 min → Studio 5,000 min) with
programmatically-verified volume discounts. 60-minute free trial granted on first login.
Minutes deducted atomically at ingest via `UPDATE … WHERE minutes_balance >= X RETURNING`.

**Why**: Subscriptions require monthly commitment — a poor fit for creators who post
episodically. Minute packs let creators pay for exactly what they use and never expire,
which is a better conversion funnel ("try 60 free minutes, buy more when you need them").
One-time Stripe Checkout is also significantly simpler to implement than subscriptions
(no Customer Portal, no dunning, no invoice lifecycle).

**Source**: Product decision, 2026-05-26. Feature branch `claude/zealous-wozniak-5KVb7`
merged into main.

## 2026-05-26 — Beta deployment: VM + Docker Compose, not Kubernetes

**What**: BETA_DEPLOYMENT phase (Issues 23–28) runs on a single cloud VM (DigitalOcean
Droplet, 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM) with Docker Compose + Cloudflare Tunnel, not Kubernetes.
This is a scoped exception to the "Docker Compose = dev only" stance in `docs/SOT.md`.

**Why**: Kubernetes is right for 10k+ scale but adds unnecessary operational complexity
for a close-friends beta with < 10 users. The existing CI/CD pipeline (`deploy.yml`)
already handles image build, SSH deploy, and DB migration — no K8s tooling needed for
beta. `docs/SOT.md` still targets GKE Autopilot for production (Issue 22 Helm charts
are ready); this is a scoped beta exception only.

**Source**: Practical deployment gap analysis, 2026-05-26. Production deployment phase
(Issues 29–30) retains the Kubernetes target.

## 2026-05-26 — Clip engine: extend end_s for early-peak candidates

**What changed**: `clip_engine/candidates.py` — `end_s` now computed as
`min(duration_s, max(peak_s + POST_PEAK_S, setup_start_s + MIN_CLIP_S))` instead of
`min(duration_s, peak_s + POST_PEAK_S)`.

**Why**: Adversarial eval fixture `peak_very_early` surfaced a bug: when a retention spike
occurs near t=0 (e.g. 12s), the setup-to-post-peak window is only ~27s, below `MIN_CLIP_S`
(30s). The candidate was silently discarded. The fix extends `end_s` just enough to meet the
minimum, so early-video hooks are never dropped.

**Source**: `tests/eval/scenarios/peak_very_early.yaml` — engine returned 0 candidates.
Debug confirmed `end_s - setup_start_s = 27.5 < 30.0`. 2026-05-26.

## 2026-05-27 — Issue 31: Operability kit (secrets registry, preflight doctor, deploy hardening, auto-heal)

### Secrets storage: plain gitignored `.env` + registry (not SOPS+age)

**What**: Secrets are kept in gitignored `.env` files (local + VM `/opt/autoclip/.env`, chmod 600),
documented in a single registry at `docs/SECRETS.md`. SOPS+age (encrypted-in-git) was considered
and deferred.

**Why**: For a <10-user close-friends beta on a single VM, plain `.env` with strict file
permissions is the industry-accepted baseline and matches the existing setup with zero new
tooling. SOPS+age adds a keypair to manage and deploy-step changes — robustness we don't need
until multi-operator or compliance requirements appear. Logged as the explicit upgrade path.

**Source**: Web research on single-VM Docker Compose secret management (GitGuardian; Docker docs;
cmmx.de SOPS/age guide), 2026-05-27. Owner chose plain `.env` + registry.

### Pre-existing bug fixed: `routers/clips.py` imported deleted `billing.tiers`

**What changed**: `routers/clips.py` imported `require_render` from `billing.tiers`, a module the
minute-packs rewrite (commit `41016e6`) deleted. The render endpoint now uses
`Depends(get_current_creator)` + `await check_positive_balance(...)`, matching the minute-packs
guard already used in `routers/videos.py`.

**Why**: The stale import meant `import main` raised `ModuleNotFoundError` — the app could not
start at all, the full test suite could not collect, and any container built from `main` would
crash on boot (a likely real cause of "deploy fails / times out"). Minutes are deducted at ingest
(`worker/tasks.py`), so a render needs only a positive-balance guard, not a second deduction.

**Source**: Discovered while running `pytest` during Issue 31 Phase 3. The breaking commit was the
unpushed local `main` commit; this fix lands on top before any push. 2026-05-27.

### Image build: amd64 only

**What**: `docker-publish.yml` builds `linux/amd64` only (was `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`).

**Why**: The DigitalOcean droplet is x86_64. The arm64 build was pure wasted CI time — roughly
doubling image build duration for an architecture nothing runs. Contributed to slow deploys.

**Source**: Deploy-time analysis, 2026-05-27. If an arm64 host is ever added, restore the matrix.

### Cloudflared in Compose + no host port + auto-heal (beta VM)

**What**: `docker-compose.prod.yml` now (a) runs `cloudflared` as a service, (b) removes the app's
`ports: 80:8000` host mapping, (c) drops the dev `--reload` from the app command, (d) adds
liveness `healthcheck`s to `app` and `worker`, and (e) adds a `willfarrell/autoheal` sidecar that
restarts containers labelled `autoheal=true` when their healthcheck goes unhealthy. The tunnel's
public-hostname ingress must target `app:8000` (Compose DNS), documented in `docs/ACCESS.md`.

**Why**: Docker has no native restart-on-unhealthy (confirmed 2026); `autoheal` + per-service
healthchecks is the standard Compose pattern. Routing inbound traffic only through the tunnel
satisfies Issue 23's "no open inbound ports" acceptance and removes the `localhost:80` vs
`app:8000` ambiguity that breaks tunnels. App healthcheck is liveness-only so a transient Postgres
blip doesn't trigger an app restart loop.

**Source**: Web research on Docker Compose auto-healing (willfarrell/autoheal; oneuptime 2026
guides), 2026-05-27.

## 2026-05-28 — Issue 44: Auth boundary hardening

### `get_current_creator`: catch ValueError/KeyError alongside PyJWTError

**What changed**: `auth.py` — `uuid.UUID(payload["sub"])` moved inside the existing
`try/except`, with `(ValueError, KeyError)` added to the caught exception types. A malformed
`sub` (non-UUID string, missing key) now returns 401 "Invalid or expired session" instead of
propagating as a 500.

**Why**: The call was outside the `try` block, so any `ValueError` from `uuid.UUID()` or
`KeyError` from a missing `sub` key fell through to the global exception handler and surfaced
as a 500 with a stack trace in development mode. Per defence-in-depth, any invalid token
payload should yield 401 — not leak error details.

**Source**: Code review of `auth.py:43`; Python `uuid.UUID` docs confirm `ValueError` on
malformed input. 2026-05-28.

---

### `DELETE /me`: add 5/hour rate limit

**What changed**: `routers/auth.py` — `@limiter.limit("5/hour")` added to the
`delete_account` handler. `request: Request` added to handler signature (required by
slowapi for key extraction).

**Why**: The right-to-erasure endpoint had no rate limit. An attacker with a stolen session
could spam it; even accidental repeated clicks should be bounded. 5/hour is generous for
legitimate use (account deletion is a one-time action) and tight enough to prevent abuse.
The existing `limiter` from Issue 18 already uses `_creator_key` (JWT sub → creator UUID),
which gives correct per-creator isolation.

**Source**: slowapi docs on `@limiter.limit`; Issue 18 pattern in `routers/videos.py`.
2026-05-28.

### `crypto.py`: MultiFernet + typed TokenDecryptError

**What changed**: `crypto.py` — `_fernet()` now returns `MultiFernet([primary])` when no
previous key is configured, and `MultiFernet([primary, previous])` when
`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` is set. `decrypt()` catches `cryptography.fernet.InvalidToken`
and re-raises as the new typed `TokenDecryptError`. `config.py` adds
`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS: str | None = None`. `.env.example` documents the rotation
workflow.

**Why MultiFernet over Fernet**: `MultiFernet.encrypt()` always uses the first (primary) key;
`MultiFernet.decrypt()` tries keys in order. This enables zero-downtime key rotation: set
`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS = old key`, run `scripts/rotate_token_key.py` to re-encrypt
all rows under the new primary, then clear `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS`. During the window
between setting the new primary and completing re-encryption, both old and new tokens are
readable. A single-key `MultiFernet([primary])` is functionally identical to `Fernet(primary)`
so there is no behaviour change when no previous key is configured.

**Why TokenDecryptError**: callers (`routers/auth.py`, `youtube/oauth.py`) were inconsistently
handling raw `cryptography.fernet.InvalidToken` — some caught it, some didn't. A project-level
typed exception makes the contract explicit and prevents internal cryptography exceptions from
leaking through unhandled.

**Source**: `cryptography` library docs on `MultiFernet`; Python exception-hierarchy best
practices. Confirmed: `MultiFernet` ships in the same `cryptography` package already pinned
in `requirements.txt`. 2026-05-28.

### Preflight doctor as the deploy gate

**What**: New `scripts/doctor.py` validates presence + format + live reachability of every secret
and prints a **redacted** status table (length + last-4 only). `config.py` keeps its fail-fast on
*missing* required vars; the doctor adds *validity* and *connectivity*. `deploy.yml` runs
`python scripts/doctor.py` after image pull and **before** migrations/cutover, so a bad secret
fails the deploy early with safe, visible output rather than a silent crash.

**Why**: The owner's core pain was being unable to see *why* a deploy failed without exposing
secrets. A redacted doctor is the standard "preflight/doctor" answer; pydantic-settings only
covers presence.

**Source**: Web research on pydantic-settings validation patterns, 2026-05-27.
